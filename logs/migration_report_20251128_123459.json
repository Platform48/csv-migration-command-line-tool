Bariloche is the gateway to the Argentinian lake district. Things to do in Bariloche For those looking for some adventure in the winter months, we'd recommend Bariloche's ski resort of Cerro Catedral, 7 miles from town. For some white water rafting, try the Rio Manso which has two sections; Manso Inferior and Manso de la Frontera. Manso Inferior is grade 2-3 and needs about 8 hours to raft. Manso de la Frontera is grade 3-4 and could take a few days to raft. Bariloche's luxury spas and hotels in the hills surrounding the town make the perfect base for day hikes into the Nahuel Huapi National Park (15 miles away in the north-eastern corner of the lake) and for longer mountain biking expeditions. Bariloche's glut of chocolate shops and its sandy beaches attract hoards of Argentinians in the summer months looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. The 'Circuito Chico' offers a leisurely trek and bus ride to spectacular viewpoints just outside Bariloche and, although quite touristy, the circuit is worth doing, in particular taking the ski lift up to the Cerro Campanario viewpoint for spectacular vistas of lakes Trebol and Moreno. Find our more about what to do in Bariloche. Accommodation Whether you want to stay in the middle of the town, or if you want to get out to a lake-side lodges or working estancia, there are plenty of options for you in Bariloche and the surrounding Lake District. Take a look at our list of recommended accommodation in the Lake District.",

The town is famous for its shingle-roofed palafitos (waterfront stilt houses), which give it a much more attractive air than when a young Charles Darwin passed through in 183 and judged it a forlorn and depressing town. Today, it’s the island’s thriving capital and an important centre for Chile’s salmon industry.Castro’s most famous attraction today is the Iglesia San Francisco de Castro – one of the 16 wooden Chilote churches that make up the island’s UNESCO World Heritage listing. While many of Chiloé's churches can be rather plain in their beauty thanks to their Jesuit roots, the Franciscan church has an exuberant riot of colour covering its neo-Gothic twin-towered exterior. It was built in 1912 to replace its predecessor which had burned to the ground, and hides its iron frame in brightly painted alerce wood, with buttery yellows offset by mauve and violet details. The interior is plainer, with richly polished wood everywhere. Just south of Castro is a second prominent church, Iglesia Nuestra Señora de Gracia de Nercon , with a tall tower easily spotted from the road. Castro has two diverting museums: the Musei Regional de Castro on the main square, which has fine displays dedicated to the original Huillipihe inhabitants, and the Museo de Arte Moderno de Chiloé , which brings the island’s story up to date by showing off Chiloés burgeoning arts scene. Castro’s Mocupulli airport (code MHC) is 20km north of the town and has daily flights to Santiago, which take just under two hours.",

Cerro Castillo is one of the landmarks on many horse riding trips in southern Patagonia as it evokes the 'estancia' lifestyle of this region. The fact that Cerro Castillo lies on the open pampas makes it a great base from which to go horse riding and gives you incredible views of Torres del Paine National Park in the distance. With regard to amenities, there isn't much save for a cafe (which does a very nice lamb soup) and shop with lots of books, clothes and goodies for tourists. The bus from Puerto Natales into Torres del Paine stops here en route. As does the bus from El Calafate, so on some trekking trips into Torres del Paine you can start from Calafate and join your group here at lunchtime, and head directly into the park that afternoon. For example this guided W Trek. More info on getting to Torres del Paine.",

Although there isn't an infinite number of things to do in the centre of El Bols&oacute;n, it is a nice place for a stroll and an ice cream, particularly when the weather is warm during Patagonian summer (Nov-March). El Bols&oacute;n is a only 1.5 hour's drive from Bariloche, and is a popular place from which to go trekking, horse riding, fly fishing and kayaking into the surrounding mountains, lakes and rivers.",

How to see it: Hiking It is possible to do a day’s hike taking in both this glacier and the nearby Laguna de Los Tres. The laguna is probably the most famous and most popular viewpoint for Mt.

The Grey Glacier is one of Torres del Paine's most spectacular glaciers, and tumbles into the serene Lago Grey. The Grey Glacier is part of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and at its peak is 30 metres high, and around six kilometres wide. How can I see it? Trekking Torres del Paine has two classic multi-day hikes, the Full Circuit and the W Trek, both of which have awe-inspiring views of the lake and the glacier. Arguably the best view comes from during the Full Circuit hike, where trekkers can view the glacier from above as they cross the famous John Garner Pass. The W Trek's western leg takes you along its eastern shore of Lago Grey all the way up to the glacier itself. You can also hike up around the lake on a day hike, returning to a comfortable base in the evening. Boat excursion Those looking for a less demanding view can take a boat trip from the southern shore right up to the glacier. Ice-hiking No experience is necessary to don crampons, grab an ice axe and get out onto the glacier. If you relish an adventure and have never before walked over the top of a glacier, this is a fantastic place to start.After her expedition onto the ice, Swoop's Harriet maintains that 'everyone should add ice hiking onto a trek in Torres del Paine!'.

It is filled by the meltwater of the Marconi Glacier on the eastern edge of the South Patagonian Ice Cap.On its western edge lies La Playita, campsite with no services other than a few piles of rocks to provide some shelter from the wind, which is normally used en route to the Ice CapTo get there you normally start out from the bridge on the Rio Electrico (around 20 mins drive north of El Chaltén) and hike through woodland along the banks of the river to Piedra del Fraile. The hike from Piedra del Fraile to La Playita is more challenging but has a clearly marked path.From the Electrico lake and river there are a couple of side-hikes worth exploring: the Pollone Valley and Piedra Negra. Both of these are best tackled with a guide."

              "web": "Laguna de los Tres is probably the most famous and most popular viewpoint for Cerro Fitz Roy. \"Los Tres\" refers to the three peaks that you can see from the laguna's shore: Fitz Roy (3,405m), Poincenot (3,002m), and Saint-Exupéry (2,558m), but the view is magnificient around all 360 degrees.This is a very popular destination, for good reason, so don't expect any solitude if you're there between November and February. The path up is well trodden and relatively easy going, with some steeper sections towards the top. Whilst there's only one approach to the laguna and the viewpoint, you can incorporate it into your itinerary in a few different ways: - Day hike from El Chaltén. This is a route where you have to retrace your steps, but it's a varied and interesting route and the round-trip might take around 8 to 9 hours. - Start from Hosteria Pilar or Piedra del Fraile campsite to the North, and return back to El Chaltén at the end of the day. This is again a full day of around 8 to 9 hours, but has the benefit of taking in Glaciar Piedras Blancas in the first part of the day, and you don't need to retrace your steps. - Use Camping Poincenot as base. This is a good option if you want to break it into shorter days; from here it's about an hour up to the viewpoint. The campsite is nice, if a little busy, and around a 3 hour hike from El Chaltén.",

              "final": "Laguna de los Tres is probably the most famous and most popular viewpoint for Cerro Fitz Roy. \"Los Tres\" refers to the three peaks that you can see from the laguna's shore: Fitz Roy (3,405m), Poincenot (3,002m), and Saint-Exupéry (2,558m), but the view is magnificient around all 360 degrees.This is a very popular destination, for good reason, so don't expect any solitude if you're there between November and February. The path up is well trodden and relatively easy going, with some steeper sections towards the top. Whilst there's only one approach to the laguna and the viewpoint, you can incorporate it into your itinerary in a few different ways: - Day hike from El Chaltén. This is a route where you have to retrace your steps, but it's a varied and interesting route and the round-trip might take around 8 to 9 hours. - Start from Hosteria Pilar or Piedra del Fraile campsite to the North, and return back to El Chaltén at the end of the day. This is again a full day of around 8 to 9 hours, but has the benefit of taking in Glaciar Piedras Blancas in the first part of the day, and you don't need to retrace your steps. - Use Camping Poincenot as base.

              "web": "Lake Tagua Tagua is a glacial finger lake in the Chilean Lake District sitting in 3000 hectares of forest that was turned into a Private Protected Area in 2013 dedicated to ecotourism. Access is by boat from the jetty at Puerto Canelo on Tagua Tagua’s northernmost point, a short walk from a cascading waterfall that marks the point where the Puelo River flows out of the lake to begin its descent to the Reconlavi Fjord. It’s possible to kayak near the falls or paddle to one of the lake’s many stony beaches. The surrounding landscape is thick with temperate rainforest and braided with well-marked hiking trails and walkways that climb the park’s steep slopes. The forest is well planted with Chilean cypress trees as well as ancient alerces, some of which might be as old as 3000 years. Under their branches, the forest floor is thick with ferns and fuschias that thrive in the damp alpine climate. The park has three refugios, Notros, Alerces and Quetrus. The first is near the entrance to the park, while the other two reward hikers prepared for a 7km and 10km respectively with truly spectacular locations. Refugio Alerces looks out across the ghostly fingers of long-dead alerces trees poking out from the waters, while Refugio Quetrus is at is near a smaller lake of the same name, which opens out to give tremendous views of the surrounding granite peaks. At the southern end of Lake Tagua Tagua is the Mitico Puelo Lodge , a former fishing lodge offering hikers a taste of mountain luxury. Lake Tagua Tagua is around a four hour drive from either Puerto Montt or Puerto Varas, via Cochamó. Mitico Puelo Lodge is a 40-minute boat ride from the Puerto Canelo jetty.",

With a day hike from Bariloche you can get up close to its glaciers. It's also possible to climb Tronador; this is a 3 day expedition, summitting on Day 2, and using the Meiling mountain hut on the first and second nights. There are actually a few different peaks on Tronador and for introductory/intermediate trips you'd tackle the 'Pico Argentino' at 3,187m. Tronador lies in the heart of Nahuel Huapi National Park, and is accessed via Pampa Linda, a short drive from San Carlos de Bariloche. It is also the source of the Manso River, one of the top white water rafting rivers in the region.",

              "web": "Panguipulli is a town in the heart of the Chilean Lake District, on the northwestern tip of Lake Panguipulli . It sits at the centre of the Seven Lakes Circuit , a notably pretty road route that runs past Lakes Calafqué, Pellaifa, Neltume, Pirehueico, Riñihue, Pullinque, and Panguipulli lakes. The modern town was only founded in the 1940s, but the region itself has been occupied for far longer: Panguipulli means ' Puma hill ' in the Mapudungun language of the original Mapuche inhabitants. Tourists visit Panguipulli for its proximity to the Huilo-Huilo Biological Reserve , as well as the word-class whitewater rafting on the nearby Fuy River , whose rapids are interspersed with a series of dramatic waterfalls. The town also has a noted gastronomic scene, and is famous for its honey, cheese and cider. Panguipulli is 145km (two hours) south of Temuco and its airport, 75km (90 minutes) from Pucón and 235km (three hours) north of Puerto Varas. The latter road in particular is very scenic. The town also offers international connections to Argentina . From nearby Puerto Fuy, a ferry runs along to Lake Pirihueico to the international border at Filo Hua Hum pass, from where a road takes you alongside Lake Lacar to San Martín de los Andes.",

We push forward through thick forest, crossing wild creeks, and up rocky steep slopes.

Hiking through the pass is certainly a challenge due to strong winds and the snow which usually covers the pass and its surrounding mountains. For this reason, it's definitely better to trek this route with a guide. The challenge is all worth it though for the views of the impressive mountains all around you.

It is an awe-inspiring pass, with views out across the Grey Glacier and, on a clear day, out across the South Patagonian Ice Cap itself. It's also one of the highest points you are likely to trek to in Torres del Paine, at an altitude of around 1,200 metres above sea level. How can I see it? On the Full Circuit multi-day hike you approach the pass from Laguna Los Perros, from the east. It's very windy up there, and the descent down to the Grey Glacier is one of the toughest sections of the whole trek. However, the views are incredible, and if you've got the time and stamina to do the Full Circuit then this view alone makes it worthwhile. Find out more about...

A global conservation site for some of the largest marine mammals , who take advantage of it's two unique sheltered inlets .The Valdes Peninsula is home to some of the ocean's largest mammals, including the Southern Right Whale, the Orca, and the Southern Elephant Seal. It is also home to an array of other marine life including dolphins and sea lions, as well as some interesting land dwellers such as guanacos, foxes, hares and armadillos, and a vast selection of bird species.We recommend that you explore Valdes' coves and beaches by sea kayaking over 1-3 days, cycling its sand dunes and heading out in a small boat to get within a few metres of a giant whale and its calf. From there take a couple of days to drive around the Peninsula and walk amongst a Magellanic penguin colony and see a beach full of basking Elephant seals. Peninsula Valdes &gt;&gt;",

It takes about 2-3 hours to get here from the Rio Electrico bridge (a 30 min transfer from El Chaltén).",

The port is stop on the Cruce Andino road-and-ferry route from Puerto Varas to Bariloche in Argentina, as well as being home to the Petrohue Lodge hotel.Following the road southwest from the town along the river takes you to the beautiful Saltos de Petrohue , a waterfall where turquoise waters charge dramatically through old lava channels. It is possible to arrange kayaking trips downstream of the falls. The fast-flowing river is also well-stocked with trout, making it an ideal flyfishing location. The Petrohue Lodge on the shore of the lake is the perfect place to base yourself and arrange either of these activities, along with canyoning, rafting and hiking. Petrohue is just under an hours' drive from Puerto Varas. From here, the ferry to Peulla departs daily in the middle of the morning. The trip takes around two hours, with the boat returning in the afternoon.",

It’s set in a spectacular location on the Reloncaví Sound, fringed with richly forested mountains, but the city itself is very much a working port: most travellers quickly transit the city to make the short hop to the pretty adventure hub of Puerto Varas, a quick 30 minute drive away, or to Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park to climb Osorno volcano.The city’s no-frills atmosphere is underlined by the fact that it was levelled by an earthquake in 1960, almost completely destroying the alpine architecture beloved by the German colonists who founded the town in 1853. The Catedral de Puerto Montt , built in alerce wood with a copper dome three years after the town was established, is the city’s oldest building. The city is built on Mapuche territory, but human habitation here stretches back farther than almost anywhere in the whole of the Americas. At nearby Monte Verde , archaeological remains including hearths, butchered animal remains and even a human footprint were uncovered in 1975 dating back around 18,500 years – a discovery that pushed back the earliest arrival of people on the South American continent by 1000 years. Puerto Montt’s Tepual airport (code PMC) is just 16km west of the town and is served by both LAN and Sky Airlines. From here you can fly to Santiago in just two hours, or south to Punta Arenas to access Torres del Paine National Park. If you want to take the scenic route to Torres del Paine, Puerto Montt is also the departure port for the four day/three night Navimag ferry to Puerto Natales, sailing through Chile’s spectacular fjords. There are no direct ferries from here to Chiloé island. Instead, you must drive 62km south on the mainland to Pargua to catch the car ferry to Chacao. Allow around three hours to transit from Puerto Montt to Ancud on Chiloé, including the 30 minute ferry ride. If you’re driving, the coastal road south from the port is considered to be the starting point for Chile’s famous Carretera Austral.",

If you want to take the scenic route to Torres del Paine, Puerto Montt is also the departure port for the four day/three night Navimag ferry to Puerto Natales, sailing through Chile’s spectacular fjords. There are no direct ferries from here to Chiloé island. Instead, you must drive 62km south on the mainland to Pargua to catch the car ferry to Chacao. Allow around three hours to transit from Puerto Montt to Ancud on Chiloé, including the 30 minute ferry ride. If you’re driving, the coastal road south from the port is considered to be the starting point for Chile’s famous Carretera Austral."

Some people choose to enter the national park via the Rio Serrano, taking a Zodiac boat down the river. One example is this 14 day trek in Torres del Paine. Also, the Serrano River is a great area for fly fishing, in the shadow of the Paine Massif. The most common fish here is the Brown trout, but you can also find some Rainbow trout and the huge Chinook Salmon, all of which can be fished by wading into the river."

After several weeks of searching, and in desperate need of food and water, he eventually found this fjord and was able to stock up on provisions in what is now Puerto Natales. Out of his joy at finding what he thought was the Strait, he named the fjord 'Seno Última Esperanza' or 'Sound of Last Hope'. A fun way to explore this fjord is by catching the ferry from Glaciar Serrano, just on the border of Torres del Paine National Park, down the Serrano river. On its way back to Puerto Natales, the ferry stops at Estancia Perales for you to enjoy a delicious lamb asado, before you continue on for the 2-hour journey back to Puerto Natales harbour. A handful of operators offer kayaking trips in the Seno Ultima Esperanza. This is a peaceful location where you can paddle up to a waterfall and camp out on the fjord's green banks.",

For Chileans it’s known best as the city where their national poet Pablo Neruda grew up and had some of his earliest poetry published. Temuco was founded in 1881 in the heartlands of Mapuche territory. It’s complicated colonial history is on display in the city’s Plaza de Armas Aníbal Pinto , named for the president who ordered the town’s creation. In the plaza’s centre stands a massive statue called Homenaje a la Regíon de la Araucanía (Tribute to the Araucanía Region), which shows a female Mapuche shaman with a raised drum on a rocky plinth surrounded on four sides by the Mapuche leader Kallfulifan, the conquistador-poet Alonso de Ercilla, a soldier of the pacification and a modern colonist. The excellent Museo Regional de la Araucanía has a strong focus on Mapuche culture. On the northern edge of Temuco, the Monumento Natural Cerro Ñielol is a 90 hectare reserve of native forest, on the spot where Mapuche leaders ceded their territory to the colonists for the founding of the town. The city is a major transport hub. Temuco’s Araucanía Airport (code ZCO) is 21km south of the city. From here it’s around a 90 minute flight to Santiago. Connections to Puerto Montt are also routed through Santiago; there are no direct flights from Temuco. Pucón is 105km south of Temuco – about a 90 minute drive. There are direct long distance buses to most cities in Chile, as well services to Bariloche in Argentina.",

Located at the East of the park, this viewpoint looks straight out onto the three granite 'torres' from which the park takes its name and beneath them, a still grey-blue lake.After having made the 2-hour journey by bus or private transfer into Torres del Paine National Park from Puerto Natales the day before, this day-trek up to the look-out (which is included in almost every operator's itinerary) starts from the base of Ascencio Valley, at Refugio Las Torres/Camping las Torres or Hotel Las Torres.The hike up to the look-out is considered by many as one of the most difficult days on the Full Circuit, alon g with Paso John Garner , as you ascend some 800 metres. It takes roughly 4 hours to reach the Torres del Paine viewpoint from the start of Valle Ascencio, a pretty windy place to trek in Patagonian summer so make sure to bring a windproof jacket if you're there between October to March. It's also important to bear in mind that the last 45 minutes up to the look-out are a steep uphill climb over rocks and sandy terrain, and many hikers take trekking poles to help their knees on the way back down. After trekking up to the look-out, hard-core climbers can continue up along Valle Silencio, past Campamento Japones and through dense rainforest for views of 'los Cuernos' mountains, Escudo (the Shield) and Fortaleza (the Fortress), as well as the back of the spectacular granite spires, Las Torres.",

Valle Frances (the French Valley) is a deep valley between mountains in Torres del Paine and is one of the main hiking attractions in the national park. It is dominated by a magnificent hanging glacier, Glaciar Frances, beech forests and the French River.It takes roughly two hours to trek into the valley before you get your first glimpse of the glacier and you can hear the rumble of small avalanches in the distance and watch ice calving from its face. How can I see it? You will hike the French Valley on Torres del Paine's two most famous multi-day hikes, the Full Circuit and the W Trek. It's also possible to do it as a day hike as part of a series of day trips in Torres del Paine, returning to a comfortable base each night.On the Full Circuit you typically approach the French Valley from the east, starting from the nearest refugio, Paine Grande. On the W Trek you'd most likely start from the west, trekking from nearby refugio cuernos. The weather is famously temperamental here, and a thick mist can descend making it impossible to reach the end of the valley. However if you do make it up to the end of the valley, expect spectacular views of Cerro Cota (2000m) and Cerro Catedral (2200m), a mountain which is said to resemble a cathedral facade.
