Ship staff will be sure to keep you posted when we cross this invisible, yet important line.",,,,,,Days 8 to 11,South Georgia,"This remote outpost was a popular stop for many historic Antarctic expeditions and was once a haven for hunting whales and elephant and fur seals. Today, South Georgia Island wildlife populations have rebounded, but you'll still see remnants of those old whaling stations and other abandoned outposts.One significant and historic site that will be of interest is the grave of the great explorer, Sir Ernest Shackleton. You can visit his grave at the settlement of Grytviken, which is also home to an old whaling station, a museum, gift shop, church and a research station of approximately 20 scientists and support personnel.While South Georgia's history is an important attraction to the islands, it is the wildlife on South Georgia that you and your shipmates will surely find most captivating. Often referred to as the Galapagos of the Poles, each landing you make on South Georgia will open your eyes to a new wonder of wildlife.One day you may see rookeries with a hundred thousand pairs of king penguins waddling on the beach. The next day we may visit another beach with thousands of fur or elephant seals. The grasses, mountains and beaches of South Georgia all play an important role in the breeding and survival of different species on the island, this fragile and symbiotic relationship is something that your Expedition Team will share with you during your time here.",,,,,,Days 12 & 13,At sea towards Antarctica,"Say goodbye to the king penguins, as your next destination is Antarctica!

Give yourself time to take in these unique moments as you explore the South Shetland Islands and western Antarctic Peninsula and with your seasoned expedition guides. These veterans of polar travel know this region intimately. They will take you through an action-packed daily itinerary that makes the most of the weather and ice conditions, as well as impromptu wildlife encounters.Twice a day the plan is to embark on exhilarating excursions, including zodiac cruises past vast crumbling glaciers and towering grounded icebergs, all while keeping a careful eye out for whales and seals. These sturdy ribs will also ferry you to land, where you might visit raucous penguin rookeries, watching these curious creatures waddle to and from the shoreline. On land, you'll stretch your legs on ice-strewn beaches or perhaps hike up snow-covered ridges for soul-stirring panoramas with towering mountains coated in a thick icing of glaciers. Extra activities, such as a polar plunge into the icy Antarctic waters for the truly adventurous, will be offered when conditions allow. Beyond zodiac cruises and landings, the ship might navigate narrow, dramatic straits between islands and the mainland or stop in scenic bays so you can admire sculptural icebergs.

",,,,,,Day 8,The Weddell Sea,"Heading northeast you'll begin to retrace the footsteps of Sir Ernest Shackleton's daring Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Your journey into the ice-laden waters of the Weddell Sea begins at the northern tip of the Peninsula, a place of stark beauty known as the Antarctic Sound. It's an area where volcanic peaks pierce the sky, penguin colonies teem with life, and wind-carved icebergs drift through the channels. In 1914, 'The Boss' and his 27-strong crew set sail into this body of water with a mission of conquering the first-ever crossing of Antarctica on foot. Yet their ship, the Endurance, became trapped in and crushed by the pack ice as they neared the starting point. While their initial goal was dashed, this unforeseen event became a catalyst for an incredible journey, forever etching Shackleton into polar history. The historic wreck of the Endurance was discovered in a near-pristine state, on March 5th 2022. As you explore the Weddell Sea, embrace the spirit of expeditionary exploration. Renowned for its gigantic tabular icebergs and swathes of sea ice attracting a wealth of wildlife, spot crabeater and Weddell seals, along with an impressive array of seabirds. All are drawn to the rich blooms of krill that thrive beneath the floating ice.",,,,,,Day 9,Elephant Island,"So exposed and battered is Cape Wild on Elephant Island that onshore landings here are extremely rare, but the Captain will try to approach the island to pay tribute to the man whose leadership kept a crew of 22 men alive for months while they awaited rescue.  Join your expedition team in the morning for an immersive lecture where you'll hear the awe-inspiring tale of Shackleton and his crew, trapped for nine gruelling months in the Weddell Sea's pack ice. After a desperate six-month journey adrift on the ice floes, they set sail in three open boats. Braving wind, relentless currents and treacherous conditions, they battled for nearly a week at sea. Finally, 497 days after their expedition began, their resilience was rewarded with landfall on Elephant Island.The journey you're on follows Shackleton's path. You'll sail past Cape Valentine, aiming to spot the very beach where the men first set foot on land over a century ago. Continuing westward along the coast, you'll reach the exposed site where Shackleton's men persevered through a brutal winter under their makeshift upturned boat shelters. Should the weather and swell allow, your team will see if it is possible to offer a zodiac cruise or landing at Point Wild. Alternatively, should this prove impossible due to unsafe conditions, the Captain will look to offer ship cruising if suitable. ",,,,,,Day 10,The Scotia Sea,"Following an action-packed adventure in Antarctica, unwind during sea days as you journey towards the wildlife mecca of South Georgia. This is the route carved by Shackleton and five crew who sailed from Elephant Island in the hopes of rescue. In an open wooden boat, they spent 17 days sailing across this treacherous part of the ocean. Finishing in King Haakon Bay on South Georgia's western side coast, surviving against all odds, it's one of the most awe-inspiring tales of maritime navigation and survival in Antarctic history.From the superb comfort of your purpose-built expedition ship, learn more about this fascinating destination through informative lectures or spend time out on deck looking for the giant cetaceans that roam these rich waters. Capture photos from the deck as cape petrels gracefully navigate the swells, with albatrosses spreading their huge wings overhead too. Throughout the voyage, the spirit of Shackleton's epic journey remains a constant presence.",,,,,,,,Days 12 to 16,South Georgia,"As you approach the rugged scenery of South Georgia, recall that Captain James Cook mistook it for a continent when he saw it for the first time in 1775!

From colossal glaciers to the echoes of human history, South Georgia is an explorer's paradise.Experience unforgettable encounters with the animals in this place known as the Serengeti of the Southern Ocean. Many Swoop travellers have described it as like walking into a nature documentary. Witness some of the world's largest king penguin rookeries, marvel at grumpy fur seals (with proper guidance and distance, of course) or wander through pebbled streams and grassy plains left by retreating glaciers. Visits to the remnants of Grytviken's whaling station and Sir Ernest Shackleton's final resting place, forever linked to this island's story, will also be on the agenda where possible.Should conditions on the trail allow, a once-in-a-lifetime day hike awaits for the more adventurous guests on board. Follow in the footsteps of Shackleton, Worsley and Crean on the final leg of their arduous trek across South Georgia.

",,,,,4,Drake Passage and South Shetland Islands,"Nearing the tip of the South Shetland Islands today, the excitement is palpable with everyone converging on the bridge watching for the first iceberg. The ocean takes on a whole new perspective once you are below the Antarctic Convergence and are surrounded by the surreal presence of floating ice sculptures. The memory of your first big iceberg sighting is likely to remain with you for a lifetime. Weather permitting, your Captain may attempt your first landing in Antarctica by late afternoon.",,,,,,5-8,Antarctic Peninsula,"Over the next few days, a host of choices are open, and depending on ice and weather conditions, the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula is yours to explore. The experienced expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design the voyage from day to day. This allows them to make the best use of the weather, ice conditions and wildlife opportunities.  Because you are so far south, you will experience approximately 18-20 hours of daylight, and the days can be as busy as you wish. The team will generally try for two landings or zodiac excursions each day; cruising along spectacular ice cliffs; following whales feeding near the surface; and landing on the continent and its off-shore islands to visit penguin rookeries, seal haulouts and historic huts. There are many exciting places to visit.  A sample of some of the types of places where yoi may cruise through, land, hike, photograph or view spectacular wildlife include: Beautiful protected bays around the Antarctic Peninsula surrounded by magnificent peaks and glaciers, areas that are havens for whales such as humpbacks, orcas, minkes and crabeater seals.Wildlife-rich islands where glaciers and mountains dominate the vista and you can see large chinstrap penguin colonies tucked in between basaltic turrets coloured by yellow and orange lichens, and where often fur seals and elephant seals are hauled out on the pebble beaches. Harbours home to gentoo penguins, which regularly host Weddell seals. The scenery is dramatic towering peaks and calving glaciers surround the harbour. The thundering crack of the glaciers as they calve is sure to stop you in your tracks.Lemaire Channel - If ice conditions allow, standing on the observation deck of your vessel quietly as the ship sails along the narrow Lemaire Channel could certainly be one of the highlights of the voyage. Cliffs tower 2,296 ft (700 m) straight out of the ocean on either side of the ship. The water can sometimes be so still that perfect reflections are mirrored on the surface, and it is clear to see why this channel is often called &ldquo;Kodak Alley&rdquo;. Gigantic icebergs may clog the area, creating navigational challenges for the Captain and crew; occasionally, they may even obstruct passage.",,,,,,9-10,Scotia Sea,"En route for South Georgia you'll head across the Scotia Sea, following the route that famed polar explorer Shackleton and five of his men took to find help for the rest of their stranded crew. On 24 April, 1916, they piled into the James Caird, the most seaworthy of their open boats, to attempt this perilous journey to South Georgia, some 802 miles (1290 km) distant. Shackleton hoped to reach South Georgia in two weeks. There, he would enlist the help of the whalers to return to Elephant Island and rescue the men left behind. As excitement builds for South Georgia, catch up with fellow expeditioners in the bar, keep watch for wildlife alongside the onboard naturalist from the open bridge, or learn more of the Shackleton story from the ship's historian.",,,,,,11-15,South Georgia,"Over the next few days, marvel at South Georgia's incredible scenes such as enormous and bustling king penguin colonies, fur seals jostling for space on the beach and jaw-dropping mountain landscapes. On zodiac cruises, discover bays filled with raucous fur seals, and land on pebble beaches to meet curious penguins. Challenge yourself on hikes and enjoy dazzling, pristine landscapes seen by few. South Georgia is a place where you can truly feel like you've really escaped from your normal daily life. Just a speck in the vastness of the South Atlantic Ocean, and lying wholly within the Antarctic Convergence, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are a life-sustaining haven to some of the world's largest congregations of wildlife. The surrounding sea is one of the most productive areas on Earth – look out for whales, penguins and other seabirds here. A mountain range forms the spine of this long, narrow island. Between the mountains, shattered glaciers carve their way through tussock grass to the deeply indented coastline. Abandoned, rusting whaling stations and remnants of explorers reflect a time long ago, while summer workers conduct scientific and regeneration projects. If conditions permit, the expedition team plan to follow in Shackleton's footsteps and complete the final leg of his walk from Fortuna Bay to Stromness.  A sample of some of the places you may land in South Georgia include: Grytviken - originally a Norwegian sealing and whaling station, it was finally closed in 1965. Sir Ernest Shackleton's body was laid to rest at Grytviken. St Andrews Bay - the long black sandy beach fronts a broad valley that stretches well back from the sea. This valley shelters the largest king penguin colony on South Georgia. Godthul - imagine indented bays lined with bleached whale bones, teeming with fur seals and penguins just &lsquo;hanging about'. A careful descent leads you to a magnificent macaroni penguin rookery. Salisbury Plains - Salisbury Plain has one of the largest king penguin colonies on South Georgia. With about 100,000 pairs, the shore and beach can be completely crammed with penguins. Along the beach, you will also find fur and elephant seals in the mix. Fortuna Bay &amp; Stromness - Fortuna Bay is surrounded by high mountains with glaciers pushing down from the high country to terminate in an open valley home to a small king penguin colony. This is where Shackleton descended from the treacherous glaciers of the interior on his way to Stromness whaling station. ",,,,,,,,16-17,At sea,"Between South Georgia and the Falklands~Malvinas, you will be entranced by the ceaseless flight of the many seabirds that follow our wake, skilfully using the air currents created by the ship to gain momentum. On this leg, we are usually travelling into the prevailing weather so it is difficult to estimate our arrival time in the Falklands~Malvinas. Our lecture program will continue and highlight all of the amazing sights we have witnessed over the past few days. We'll have ample time to enjoy the rest of our time observing the sea birds, whale watching from the bridge, or simply relaxing in the bar with a book. If time and weather conditions permit, we could pass close to Shag Rocks, a fascinating group of jagged rocky islets protruding from the sea, in the proximity of South Georgia.",,,,,,18,At sea / Falkland Islands,"The sea and weather conditions en route from South Georgia will determine the time of your arrive into the Falkland Islands today. Located 477 kilometres/296 miles east of southern Argentina, the Falklands are a unique mix of wildlife hotspot and inhabited outpost. There are two main islands, East and West, with only seven of the archipelago's 700 islands are inhabited. The cold nutrient-rich waters surrounding the islands makes them a prime location for marine life including seabirds and seals.Day 19: At sea / Falkland Islands",,,,,,20,At sea,"You may choose to spend the sea day returning to Ushuaia editing your photos, enjoying the onboard facilities, or listening to an informative lecture.

Several species of bird follow the vessel southeast, such as albatrosses, storm petrels, shearwaters, and diving petrels.",,,,,,,,,,,,Day 4,Exploring the Falkland Islands,"The Falkland (Malvinas) Islands offer an abundance of wildlife that is easily approachable, though caution is always advised. These islands are largely unknown gems, the site of a 1982 war between the UK and Argentina. Not only do various species of bird live here, but chances are great you'll see both Peale's dolphins and Commerson's dolphins in the surrounding waters.  During this segment of the voyage, you may visit the following sites:  Steeple Jason - Home to the world's largest black-browed albatross colony (roughly 113,000), Steeple Jason is a wild and rarely visited island buffeted by wind and waves. Weather and swell conditions dictate the journey here.  Carcass Island - Despite its name, this island is pleasantly rodent-free and hence bounteous with birdlife. Anything from breeding Magellanic penguins and gentoos to numerous waders and passerine birds (including Cobb's wrens and tussock-birds) live here.  Saunders Island - On Saunders Island you can see the black-browed albatross and its sometimes-clumsy landings, along with breeding imperial shags and rockhopper penguins. King penguins, Magellanic penguins, and gentoos are also found here.",,,,,,,Day 5,Visiting Port Stanley,"The capital of the Falklands and center of its culture, Port Stanley has some Victorian-era charm: colorful houses, well-tended gardens, and English-style pubs are all to be found here. You can also see several century-old clipper ships nearby, silent witnesses to the hardships of 19th century sailors. The small but interesting museum is also worth a visit, covering the early days of settlement up to the Falklands War. Approximately 2,100 people live in Port Stanley. Feel free to wander at will, though be aware that admission fees to local attractions are not included in the voyage. Admission fees to local attractions are not included.",,,,,,Days 6 & 7,At sea towards South Georgia,"En route to South Georgia, you now cross the Antarctic Convergence. The temperature cools considerably within the space of a few hours, and nutritious water rises to the surface of the sea due to colliding water columns. This phenomenon attracts a multitude of seabirds near the ship, including several species of albatross, shearwaters, petrels, prions, and skuas. ",,,,,,Days 8 to 11,Exploring South Georgia,"Today you arrive at the first South Georgia activity site. Please keep in mind that weather conditions in this area can be challenging, largely dictating the program.  Sites you might visit include:  Prion Island - This location is closed during the early part of the wandering albatross breeding season (November 20 - January 7). The previous summer's wandering albatross chicks are almost ready to fledge, and adults are seeking out their old partners after a year and a half at sea.  Salisbury Plain, St. Andrews Bay, Gold Harbour - These sites not only house the three largest king penguin colonies in South Georgia, they're also three of the world's largest breeding beaches for southern elephant seals. Only during this time of year do they peak in their breeding cycle. Watch the four-ton bulls keep a constant vigil (and occasionally fight) over territories where dozens of females have just given birth or are about to deliver. You can also see a substantial number of Antarctic fur seals here during the breeding season (December - January).  Fortuna Bay - Near beaches inhabited by various penguins and seals, you have the chance to follow the final leg of Shackleton's route to the abandoned whaling village of Stromness. This path cuts across the mountain pass beyond Shackleton's Waterfall, and as the terrain is partly swampy, be prepared to cross a few small streams.  Grytviken - In this abandoned whaling station, king penguins walk the streets and elephant seals lie around like they own the place - because they basically do. Here you might be able to see the South Georgia Museum as well as Shackleton's grave.",,,,,,Day 12,At sea towards the South Orkney Islands,"There may be sea ice on this route, and at the edge of the ice some south polar skuas and snow petrels could join the other seabirds trailing the vessel south.",,,,,,,,Day 13,Travelling in the South Orkney Islands,"Depending on the conditions, you might visit Orcadas Base, an Argentine scientific station on Laurie Island in the South Orkney archipelago. The personnel here will happily show you their facility, where you can enjoy expansive views of the surrounding glaciers. If a visit isn't possible, you may instead land in Signy Island's Shingle Cove.",,,,,,Day 14,At sea towards Antarctica,"Enormous icebergs and a fair chance of fin whale sightings ensure there's never a dull moment on this last sea voyage south. Also, your best chance to spot Antarctic petrels is here.",,,,,,Days 15 to 18,In the Antarctic Peninsula,"If the ice conditions permit, you now sail into the Weddell Sea. Here colossal tabular icebergs herald your arrival to the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula. Paulet Island, with its large population of Ad&eacute;lie penguins, is a possible stop. You might also visit Brown Bluff, located in the ice-clogged Antarctic Sound, where you could get the chance to set foot on the Antarctic Continent itself.  If conditions aren't favorable to enter the Weddell Sea from the east, the ship will set course for Elephant Island and head into the Bransfield Strait, between South Shetland Island and the Antarctic Peninsula. Here you can attempt to access the Antarctic Sound from the northwest.  The volcanic islands of the South Shetlands are windswept and often cloaked in mist, but they nonetheless offer many subtle pleasures. A wide variety of flora (mosses, lichens, flowering grasses) and fauna (gentoo penguins, chinstrap penguins, southern giant petrels) live here. Chinstrap penguins and Weddell seals often haul out onto the beach near C&aacute;mara Base, an Argentine scientific research station on Half Moon Island.  On Deception Island, the ship plunges through Neptune's Bellows and into the flooded caldera. Here you can find hot springs, an abandoned whaling station, and thousands of cape petrels. A number of kelp gulls, brown skuas, south polar skuas, and Antarctic terns can be spotted too. Wilson's storm petrels and black-bellied storm petrels also nest in the ruins of the whaling station in Whalers Bay. As an alternative, you can take part in activities near Telefon Bay, further inside the caldera. This extended voyage gives you the chance to sail even farther down the icy coast of the western Antarctic Peninsula. In the Gerlache Strait are several opportunities for great landings where you might set foot on the Antarctic Continent, surrounded by an epic landscape of alpine peaks and mammoth glaciers calving at sea level. Gentoo penguins, leopard seals, Weddell seals, humpback whales, and minke whales are often seen here. The breathtaking scenery continues in the southern Gerlache Strait, and if ice conditions allow, we may even reach Lemaire Channel. Conditions on the Drake Passage determine the exact time of departure.",,,,,,Days 19 & 20,At sea towards Ushuaia,"Your return voyage is far from lonely. While crossing the Drake, you're again greeted by the vast array of seabirds remembered from the passage south. But they seem a little more familiar to you now, and you to them.",,,,,,,Day 21,Disembarking in Ushuaia,"You arrive and disembark in Ushuaia, commonly held to be the world's most southern city.

It is often the naturalist guides' favourite location to explore, so dense is the wildlife found here. This sub-Antarctic island is bursting with rich polar historical connections, surprisingly lush ecology and dramatic jagged mountains lined with pouring glaciers. The undeniable stars of South Georgia are the king penguins, the second largest penguin species. Exact numbers are unknown, though thought to be around half a million birds. But one vast colony on the island is estimated to have as many as 200,000 of these iconic birds clustered together. These rookeries are an assault on all the senses and completely impossible to accurately represent in a paragraph! Interwoven with these penguins you will find a rich tapestry of marine mammals, from belligerent fur seals to enormous cantankerous elephant seals. For many history buffs, South Georgia is intricately interlaced with the epic tales of Sir Ernest Shackleton's unthinkable rescue journey. If the conditions are right, the guides may be able to take guests with a good level of fitness to hike up to the spot where he heard with great relief the noon whistle from the Stromness Station. The ship will also attempt to land at Grytviken to propose a toast at Shackleton's grave. Here there are the haunting remnants of the island's terribly destructive industrial whaling past.

During your time in the Falklands you may stop in to explore Stanley, the charmingly petite capital of the islands. It's a surprising outpost of British culture blended with hints of wilderness. Look out for the iconic red telephone box and post box and pass the Anglican Cathedral with its impressive archway of whalebones. Many Falkland Islanders still live a traditional farming lifestyle and there may be a chance to visit a small farm to see some expert sheep shearing and learn about the best techniques for cutting blocks of peat for the fire. The unusual contrast of man-made rolling green pastures and glorious wildlife such as colonies of black-browed albatross and rockhopper penguins is thought-provoking.",,,,,,Day 21,At sea towards Ushuaia,"The final day on the water takes you across the shallow Falklands Shelf and back up the Beagle Channel towards Ushuaia.

Here we may encounter wildlife such as Yellow-nosed albatrosses and Sub-Antarctic fur seals and otherwise explore a very rarely visited spot. We aim to land at Nightingale and Inaccessible islands, with views of seabirds ranging from yellow-nosed albatrosses to brown noddies.

These days also allow a buffer for flight and luggage delays should your travels to Chile not go as scheduled.During these days, a clothing and equipment check will be arranged at your hotel. The day before your departure, all luggage will be prepared and your checked luggage will be collected. The evening before the flight you will join the safety briefing, which will introduce you to the process, update on current weather, and prepare you for your arrival at Union Glacier. Afterwards, you can enjoy hors d'oeuvres and pisco sours with your fellow travellers.",,,,,,,Day 1,Fly to Antarctica,"In the morning, you'll be advised on current weather conditions and whether the flight will therefore be going ahead. If the weather is suitable, you'll be picked up from the hotel within the hour and transfer to Punta Arenas Airport.Fly a little more than 4 hours to Antarctica by private transport jet. The route crosses the Drake Passage, then follows the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula and the spine of the Ellsworth Mountains. You'll land on the blue-ice runway on Union Glacier Camp where you will take your first steps in Antarctica. Climb aboard a van for the 5 mile (8 km) transfer to the main camp (Union Glacier Camp), where staff will be waiting to welcome you.When weather conditions permit, you will continue by ski aircraft to Vinson Base Camp. The guides will keep you informed of the weather and when your onward flight is likely to depart. In most cases, you will spend at least one night at Union Glacier Camp before flying to Vinson. On rare occasions, you may be shuttled to Vinson on the same day you arrive in Antarctica.Every effort will be made to keep to the scheduled flight date and we will depart as soon as weather and runway conditions permit. Please understand that delays are common in Antarctic travel. All flights are dependent on weather, aircraft serviceability, and local conditions. Our staff will stay in close contact with you and will provide you with regular flight updates.",,,,,,,,,,,,Days 2-3,Vinson Base Camp,"Vinson Base Camp is situated at an elevation of 7021 ft (2140 m) on the Branscomb Glacier and offers you a spectacular setting to relax and recover from your travels to Antarctica while you prepare for the climb ahead. Here you will meet the experienced mountain guides that will be climbing with you. On the first day, your guide will take your team on a short acclimatisation hike which allows you to gain familiarity with the Antarctic environment and refine your clothing and equipment choices for the climb. The team sizes are kept small so the guides can assess individual strengths and challenges for each team member to develop a strategy that maximizes everyone's chance for a successful ascent. The following day, you will pack your personal equipment as well as a small amount of food and fuel.Your team will ascend Vinson using the Branscomb Shoulder Route (standard route). The climb usually takes 5-9 days depending on weather conditions and how quickly team members acclimatise. Most groups set two intermediate camps on the mountain prior to attempting the summit. Your climb is a team effort and at the end of each day, everyone will help pitch camp. The rate of ascent and daily climbing plan will be set by your guide to ensure everyone's safety and success.You'll travel roped together throughout your time on the mountain due to crevasse hazard.",,,,,,,Days 3-4,Base Camp to Low Camp,"From Vinson Base Camp, you'll follow the gradual rise of the Branscomb Glacier to Low Camp (9121 ft/2780 m). This gentle climb is ideal for pulling sleds, allowing you to lighten your pack load. Typically climbers split their 40-49 lb (18-22 kg) loads by carrying 30% in a backpack and 70% on a sled when they leave Base Camp. The climb to Low Camp takes 4-6 hours and ascends 2100 ft (640 m) where a large dining tent and cached sleeping tents await for your first night on the mountain. Low Camp is in the shade until the late morning and it is normal for people to stay in bed until the sun hits the tents. After a late breakfast, your guide will lead an excursion to a nearby viewpoint and you may visit the lower section of the fixed lines for some additional training and familiarisation. Strong parties may wish to make an ascent of Knutzen Peak (11,066 ft/3373m), a 5-6 hour round trip from Low Camp.",,,,,,Day 6,Low Camp to High Camp,"When conditions are suitable and the forecast indicates stable weather ahead, your team will leave the sleds at Low Camp and ascend to High Camp (12,402 ft/3780 m) carrying all of your equipment in backpacks. Low Camp to High Camp is 3,281 ft (1000 m) of elevation gain and usually takes groups 6-8 hours to complete. The route takes you up the broad mixed spur at the northern end of Branscomb Ridge, offering fantastic views of Mount Shinn and the glaciers below. The hike to the start of the fixed ropes takes less than 1 hour. You'll ascend fixed ropes on snow covered slopes up to 45&deg;. Snow conditions can vary from soft to hard and wind-blown with icy patches. The ascent of the fixed ropes takes approximately 4-5 hours. There is a large ledge at the half-way point where you can stop for a rest and enjoy some food and drink. The hike from the top of the fixed lines to High Camp takes about 1.5 hours, ascending the gentle slopes of the summit glacier. This final section of the route can be very exposed to the wind, requiring care to prevent cold injury. The facilities at High Camp are more basic than those at Low Camp. Your guide will prepare simple meals in a cooking shelter and you can eat inside your tent or outside if the weather is calm. The next day is normally spent resting and acclimatizing at High Camp to give everyone the best chance of summiting.",,,,,,Days 7-8,High Camp to Summit,"Your team will make its summit attempt on the best weather day possible based on forecasts predicting good visibility and low winds. High Camp to Mount Vinson's Summit is 3,648 ft (1112 m) of elevation gain and takes most teams 9-12 hours round-trip. The majority of the route is along the gently angled Vinson summit valley, with a short, steeper snow and ice slope leading to the spectacular, rocky, summit ridge. Parts of the route are exposed and can be subject to high winds. The summit pyramid can be climbed via two routes. The easiest route is via the left- hand (eastern) ridge which is less steep than the right-hand (western) ridge. Many teams traverse the peak by climbing the right-hand and descending the left-hand route. Your guide will select the route that is most appropriate based on the weather conditions and the abilities of the team. The views from the summit are breathtaking. Mount Gardner, Tyree, Epperly, and Shinn dominate the foreground, surrounded by impressive peaks that rise from the vast ice sheet below. Here, at the top of Antarctica, the true scale and majesty of the continent are overwhelmingly apparent. Take time for photos and savour the experience before retracing your steps to High Camp.",,,,,,Day 9,Descent to Vinson Base Camp,"The descent to Vinson Base Camp usually takes one day from High Camp, re-tracing your route down the fixed ropes and along the Branscomb Glacier. At Base Camp you'll celebrate your summit with a hearty celebration meal and toast to your team!",,,,,,,,Days 10-11,Return to Union Glacier Camp,"Vinson Base Camp will stay in close contact with Union Glacier Camp to identify the best &lsquo;weather window' for your return flight. Depending on  flights, you may have at least one day at the end of your expedition to explore more of Union Glacier. Enjoy a hot shower and celebrate your summit with your team! Here you will receive a certificate to commemorate your Mount Vinson Expedition.",,,,,,Day 12,Return to Chile,"When weather and runway conditions permit, our intercontinental aircraft will arrive at Union Glacier to transport you back to Chile.

",,,,,,,,,,,,Days 3 to 5,Exploring the Falkland Islands,"The Falklands (Malvinas) have an abundance of wildlife. This collection of 700+ islands includes largely unknown gems, home to many bird species, including Magellanic and rockhopper penguins. Keep a lookout for Peale's and Commerson's dolphins too, which can sometimes be spotted in the surrounding waters.The Falkland Islands offer some fantastic options for wildlife-rich hikes across the rugged terrain. Elegant black-browed albatrosses are found nesting on the cliffs here, often interspersed with shags and penguins, making for an eclectic mix.  The white-sand beaches feel at odds with the windswept vistas, and there is a curious visual juxtaposition of grazing sheep and cattle with nesting penguins! During your time in the Falklands you may also visit the capital of the islands. Port Stanley has a quirky charm with colourful houses, well-tended gardens and English-style pubs. The small but interesting museum is also worth a visit, covering the early days of settlement up to the Falklands War. Approximately 2,500 people live in Port Stanley. You will have some free time to explore - we recommend checking out the archway by the church, made from the jawbones of two blue whales. There are also some artisan shops stocked with souvenirs. ",,,,,,,Days 6 & 7,At sea towards South Georgia,"On the way to South Georgia, you will cross the Antarctic Convergence. Entering Antarctic waters, the temperature may drop significantly in the time span of only a few hours. Near the convergence, you will see a multitude of southern seabirds, including several species of albatrosses, shearwaters, petrels, prions and skuas.",,,,,,Days 8 to 11,South Georgia,"Today, you will reach the spectacular and remote island of South Georgia. Please keep in mind that weather conditions in this area can be challenging, largely dictating the programme. Your Captain and Expedition Leader will look for the best and safest opportunities for your adventures here. As the location is home to some of the world's most jaw-dropping wildlife, you will want to keep your camera and binoculars with you at all times. Here, king penguins can be found in their thousands, recolonising areas once covered by glaciers. In the early season, the beaches are littered with elephant seals and male fur seals setting out their territory. Later on in the season, curious fur seal pups carpet the coastline. As well as phenomenal wildlife, the island also has a rich human history, though not all of it pleasant. During your time exploring you may see the rusting vestiges of the whaling industry, including at Grytviken. Here, you may drop anchor to head to the cemetery to toast ""The Boss"" - legendary explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, who is buried here. ",,,,,,Day 12,At sea towards the South Orkney Islands,"Set off towards the little-visited South Orkney islands.

Our goal is to attempt two excursions per day while we navigate through the area but our itinerary and daily schedule will be based on the local weather and ice conditions that we encounter.The Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands abound with wildlife activity. Penguins gather with their fast-growing chicks, whales are seen in great numbers, seals haul out onto ice floes and beaches, and numerous seabirds trail in our wake. We may visit scientists working in modern research bases, and there is plenty of time to enjoy the sheer beauty and the breathtaking scenery of ice-choked waterways, blue and white icebergs, impressive glaciers and rugged snow-capped mountains.

Weather permitting we will have 3 full days to explore this island. A huge colony of king penguins is the highlight of this part of the journey. On nearby islands, we'll hope to spot wandering albatross in their nesting grounds.Known for its brutal whaling and exploratory history, this 170 km long and 40 km wide island was the centre of the huge Southern Ocean whaling industry from 1904 to 1966. The famous captain James Cook was the first to land on South Georgia on January 17, 1775 and named the island after King George III. During the 62 years of whaling activities, any number between 183 whales the first year and the record 7825 whales in 1925-26 season were killed annually for their oil. Whales weren't the only animals hunted for their oil at that time. A total of 498,870 seals - mostly giant elephant seals - were also slaughtered. Since the end of whaling activities 40 years ago, wildlife has slowly returned to the island.Today the Island's wildlife is extraordinary, not only in its variety but also for its sheer abundance. South Georgia is home to roughly 300,000 elephant seals, 3 million fur seals, and 25 species of breeding birds, including wandering albatrosses. The gravel beach at St. Andrews Bay has a king penguin rookery of 100,000. The British explorer Sir Ernest H Shackleton landed at King Haakon Bay on the south-west coast after the 800-mile journey in a 20-foot open boat from Elephant Island. They proceeded to hike the ice-covered mountainous terrain, arriving into Stromness whaling station on May 20, 1916. Shackleton returned to South Georgia in 1922 for one last assault on Antarctica but passed away after suffering a major heart attack while in his cabin. He was buried in the whaler's cemetery at Grytviken station at the request of his wife.",,,,,,Days 16 & 17,The Southern Ocean,"Sailing west now, we'll set course for the Fallkland Islands (Las Islas Malvinas). Our days at sea will be filled with lectures and we will have plenty of time on deck to identify the abundant sea birds of the south ocean. We keep our eye peeled for the whales that inhabit these waters.",,,,,,,,Days 18 & 19,The Falkland Islands,"The Falkland Islands provide a rare opportunity to witness the biological diversity and extraordinary scenery of the southern islands. Nesting albatross, penguins and elephant seals are abundant. Port Stanley provides an opportunity to meet the hardy local inhabitants whose colourful houses provide contrast to the long dark winters.The islands consist of 700 small and mostly uninhabited islands and 2 main islands - East and West Falklands. Located 490 km east of Patagonia, the Falklands have always been a land of hot debate. Officially discovered on August 14, 1592 by John Davis they remained uninhabited until 1764 when the French built a garrison at Port Louis disregarding the Spanish claim to the islands. From that moment on there have been many disputes between Spain, France, Britain and Argentina over the next 200 plus years until the end of the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina in 1982 brought the islands firmly under Britain's control. The islands are now home to a human population of only 2,491 but an abudance of wildlife. We hope to catch glimpses of penguins, including the Magellanic, rockhopper, gentoo, and king penguins. With a little luck, we may also see elephant seals, sea lions, king cormorants, black-browed albatross, skuas, night herons, giant petrels, striated caracaras and of course sheep.",,,,,,Day 20,Return to Ushuaia,"Reflect on a memorable adventure and take in some final lectures en route back to Ushuaia, reviewing the highlights of the Antarctic experience with the lecturers and staff.",,,,,,Day 21,Disembark Ushuaia,Our adventure comes to a close.

Curious penguins often come very close, offering superb photographic opportunities. Among the shifting mass of penguins, we will find Carsten Borchgrevink's Hut, the oldest in Antarctica, an overwintering shelter for the first expedition to the Antarctic continent in 1899.Cape Hallett: The enormous Admiralty Range heralds our arrival; wild and extraordinary, the mountains rear up from the sea to over 4,000m, bounded by colossal glaciers. We land at an abandoned base site, now home to large numbers of Adelie penguins and Weddell seals.Franklin Island: Desolately beautiful and rugged, this is home to a large Adelie penguin population and other nesting seabirds. We attempt a landing and explore the coastline.Possession Islands: Rarely-visited, small and rugged, these rocks support tens of thousands of penguins. Observe the birds busy and humorous activity, with the Admiralty Mountains forming a superb backdrop across the water.Ross Ice Shelf: The world's largest body of floating ice and a natural barrier, at times, creating hazardous weather, with sheets of snow blown at gale force by winds off the polar ice cap. Just 800 miles from the South Pole, this daunting spectacle prevented many early explorers from venturing further south. We cruise along its dizzying 30m high ice cliffs, perhaps lucky enough to see icebergs calving.Ross Island: Mount Erebus/Cape Bird/Shackleton's Hut/Scotts Hut(s) and visits to a scientific field station (Scott and McMurdo Stations are high on our wish list but ice, weather and station operational requirements often make them inaccessible). Ross Island was and is the hub of activity in the Ross Sea, dominated by Mt Erebus, a monstrous active volcano named after the ancient Greek God of Darkness. The carefully preserved huts of the Heroic Era help make the history come alive. If we can reach the bases we get a modern perspective on Antarctic Research.Terra Nova Bay: An Italian research station where the scientists are always hospitable and enjoy showing us around their lonely but beautiful home.

Our Expedition Leader and Captain will create a flexible itinerary based on weather, ice and opportunity. We will approach the Antarctic Peninsula from the east to cross the northern boundary of the Weddell Sea, where a large cold body of water rotates clockwise driving cold water and ice north towards South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands. Large tabular icebergs born in the Weddell drift north into our path while the ocean currents drive nutrients from the deep, feeding countless species of marine animals. Large groups of whales are common, along with scores of seabirds thriving off the bounty the Weddell provides. Our route will stress the most scenic bays and channels of the Peninsula with stops at penguin rookeries, seal wallows, bird colonies and whale feeding areas as well as sites of historic and scientific interest.Adelie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins abound, and Weddell, crabeater and elephant seals are often found hauled out to rest along with predatory leopard seals and the aggressive Antarctic fur seal.

Wild windswept mountains rise above the tree line and are regularly dusted with snow. The mountain range of &ldquo;Dientes de Navarino&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;teeth of Navarino&rdquo;), completes the dramatic backdrop. Originally used by the Yaghan people, a hunter-gatherer tribe, the area was abandoned by them upon the arrival of European settlers. The current city was established as a naval base in 1953; its name honours the British-Chilean naval commander John Williams Wilson of the 16th century. Initially protecting territorial possessions and fishing rights in the area, as well as offering logistical support to Antarctic bases, it has now become a departure point for scientific and tourist trips to the Antarctic region. Puerto Williams charms the visitor with a small village feel, complete with rustic buildings and a homely smell of drifting wood smoke.

Head to the gym, visit the spa, spend some time whale watching or catch up on your reading. These sea days are the perfect balance to busy days spent exploring on shore when you reach your destination.",,,,,,,Day 3,"New Island & West Point Island, the Falklands","Remote and raw, New Island lies to the west of the Falkland Islands, and the human population here is far outweighed by the bustling birdlife that resides along its craggy coastline. Out in the tempestuous wilds of the South Atlantic Ocean, this island is a sanctuary of animal life: crowds of rockhopper penguins, wrinkled seals and stern-looking albatross number among its many residents. The penguins of the Falklands are a sight to see, fooling around on the beaches and then diving in and whipping through the water. This place is home to five different species, including king penguins that strut proudly with their orange collars glowing against their pure white chests. Sea lions, seals and elephant seals lumber along the shoreline, while Peale's dolphins cut through the waves and sleek orcas patrol menacingly. The rookery cliffs rattle with the sounds of crashing waves and the echoing shouts of rockhopper penguins, black-browed albatross and king cormorants. Gorgeous sweeping landscapes are littered with shipwrecks and sprinkles of colourful wildflowers. A warm welcome is guaranteed, signalled with towering platters of cakes and biscuits with tea and coffee, when the local custom of smoko is served up. However, things haven't always been so peaceful here and if you wish, you can pay a visit to the battlefields and memorials of the 1982 war, when the UK and Argentina clashed fiercely over these islands.West Point Island is an outpost of the Falkland Islands where you'll be welcomed ashore by the calls and cries of a huge colony of black-browed albatross. The island was originally known as Albatross Island before being renamed to reflect its geographic location. The albatrosses are far from the only animal inhabitants of this remote and isolated land. A huge array of birdlife calls the island sanctuary home. Rockhopper penguins scamper and burrow along the coast's boulders and imperial cormorants roost here in great numbers. You're also bound to encounter Magellanic penguins during your explorations. Hike through the island's quiet landscapes and look out for endemic plants like Felton's flower which carpets the green interior. Cliff Mountain, a towering sandstone monolith is the archipelago's highest cliff which falls away to swirling waves below where you'll spot Commerson's dolphin chasing each other around the island, visiting whales and fur seals lounging on the island's inviting shores.",,,,,,Day 4,Port Stanley,"Stanley, despite its Britishness, resembles Patagonia more than Portsmouth. The windswept, vast and achingly beautiful landscape of the Falkland Islands is juxtaposed with the odd pub serving ales and even fish and chips. The landmark whalebone arch of Christ Church Cathedral, is 100% local but you will also find a good smattering of imported garden gnomes and Union Jackswhich serve as a reminder of whose territory you are really on. Ever since colonisation in the 18th Century, The Falkland Islands' ownership has been a matter of controversy and at various points in their life they have been considered French, British, Spanish and Argentine. The short Falklands War in 1982, saw the British cling to this remote outpost and the islands remain part of the British Commonwealth today. British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, under whom the war was masterminded, remains something of a local hero and is memorialised in street signs such as Thatcher Drive. For those who wish to dig deeper into the past, the Historic Docklands Museum provides lots of information on the chequered historical and political background of the islands. The true heroes of Stanley are of course the thousands and thousands of penguins. Five species nest here during mating season including the rare rockhopper penguin. There are virtually no barriers between you and the wildlife, allowing for an interactive, authentic and totally unforgettable experience.",,,,,,Days 5 & 6,At sea towards South Georgia,"Days at sea are the perfect opportunity to relax and unwind. Head to the gym, visit the spa, spend some time whale watching or catch up on your reading. These sea days are the perfect balance to busy days spent exploring on shore when you reach your destination.",,,,,,Days 7 to 9,South Georgia,"Charcoal-black mountains dusted with snow, giant glaciers and thriving wildlife combine to make South Georgia one of the world's greatest natural islands. Animals are in charge and humans come a distant second. Every-day occurrences here include a cacophony of calling birds, elephant seals clashing and thrashing and crowds of colourful king penguins stretching for as far as the eye can see. With vivid bursts of yellow and orange around their necks the king penguins stand, squabble and curiously investigate, enjoying the isolated respite of the island. They're joined by smaller penguin species including Macaroni penguins and other glorious birdlife like majestic wandering albatrosses seen gliding on gusts of wind over choppy waves.These isolated subantarctic islands once formed a remote whaling centre and you can pay a visit to the former whaling stations. Nowadays the giants of the sea are free to cruise the icy waters uninhibited. The island is written into explorer history thanks to the heroic tale of Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, shipwreck and survival. The crew of his ship, The Endurance were saved when he reached the salvation of these shores in 1916, before returning to collect the remaining sailors from Elephant Island. A museum commemorates the legendary mission, and there is a memorial to Shackleton that stands over his final resting place on this fabled island.

Head to the gym, visit the spa, spend some time whale watching or catch up on your reading. These sea days are the perfect balance to busy days spent exploring on shore when you reach your destination.",,,,,,Day 12,Elephant Island,"Elephant Island is perhaps Antarctica's best-known location and promises thrilling adventure, legendary tales and immaculate Antarctic beauty. Believed to take its name from the elephant seals that early explorers spotted lounging on its rocks, the volcanic island was not properly explored until 1916 when Ernest Shackleton and his men were beaten by the weather and sought shelter on its shores. Their story is one of humanity's most evocative and inspiring accounts of survival and you'll discover Shackleton's tale for yourself as you arrive at the island's icy shores. The remarkable, slowly flowing Endurance Glacier takes its name from Shackleton's ship, The Endurance. A monument to Shackleton also stands here and is often surrounded by a migrating crowd of tiny gentoo penguins.At Point Wild, Shackleton and his 28 crew members camped for four and a half months of Antarctic winter. Eventually, Shackleton and a handful of courageous others sailed for South Georgia Island. They then returned to rescue the remaining crew members. Not only will you be amid breathtaking landscapes, witnessing incredible wildlife and experiencing the rush of adventure into the unknown, you will also know one of the true joys of any Antarctic cruise: to follow in the footsteps of brave explorers who first sought out these alluring, dangerous and evocative landscapes. ",,,,,,Day 13,Antarctic Sound,"The Sound is an assault on the senses with imposing iceberg slabs that have broken away from the disintegrating Larsen Ice Shelf. You will come face-to-face with the extraordinary birds that call this landscape their home. Gentoo penguins hop around, and cape petrels sweep overhead. Before departure, you'll want to brush up on your photography skills to capture this magnificent sight in all of its unrestrained glory. ",,,,,,Days 14 & 15,The Antarctic Peninsula,"The Antarctic Peninsula lies a mere 620 miles from Tierra del Fuego (the southern tip of South America) yet was unseen by humans until 1820. The peninsula offers the thrill of the truly unknown and extraordinary. It is sprinkled with research bases at the frontline of human scientific endeavour, their inhabitants dedicated to the study of a unique landscape, its exceptional wildlife, and the impact that humans are having on this pristine continent. Cathedral-sized icebergs will loom up close, blue-hued glaciers will slowly slip into view from imposing locations like Hope Bay and thousands of adorable Adelie penguin pairs are to be found thriving, undisturbed in this unique setting.",,,,,,,Day 16,South Shetland Islands,"The South Shetland Islands lie close to the northwestern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, separated by the Bransfield Strait. Several countries maintain research bases here and with plump elephant seals, and crowds of gentoo, chinstrap and Adelie Penguins also calling the islands home, it can sometimes feel a little crowded! King George Island is the largest and hosts the majority of the research stations, some of which are populated all-year-round by small yet hardy crews. These islands offer extraordinary adventure in one of the most remote locations on Earth. Towering over the archipelago are the triple peaks of Mount Foster and you're bound to feel your heart pumping a little faster, as you sail into the centre of Deception Island's magnificent collapsed volcano caldera. ",,,,,,Day 17,Drake Passage,"Crossing back into the Drake Passage you will relive the chance to navigate those legendary seas with albatros, petrels and dolphins for company.",,,,,,Day 18,Sailing around Cape Horn,"No two words conjured up more fear to sailors of the past than Cape Horn. A reputation for ferocious storms and mountainous seas, the cape was a place where a seafarer garnered respect for bravery against the odds. Once an unavoidable physical gateway to adventure and commerce in the Pacific Ocean, Cape Horn nowadays has more of a spiritual attraction. It draws intrepid travellers who wish to pay homage to the brave sailors who once risked their lives to pass this wild and inhospitable headland.When the weather is clear from the frequent icy squalls that batter the island's shores, a 23 feet (7m) high steel monument can be seen standing about 1 mile (1.5km) away from the true cape, near the Chilean navy station. It is the silhouette of an albatross, the bird that is said to carry the souls of those sailors who perished &ldquo;rounding the Horn&rdquo;.",,,,,,Day 19,Puerto Williams,"<p>Returning to Puerto Williams after your Antarctic adventure, it is time to disembark and say farewell to the crew, the expedition teams and your fellow travellers as you head on <span>your included charter flight back up to Santiago. </span></p>","Returning to Puerto Williams after your Antarctic adventure, it is time to disembark and say farewell to the crew, the expedition teams and your fellow travellers as you head on your included charter flight back up to Santiago.

Here you will embark on your ship and set sail.",,,,,,,Day 1,Puerto Williams,"A Chilean town, located on the southern shores of the Beagle Channel, Puerto Williams is surrounded by magnificent scenery. Wild windswept mountains rise above the tree line and are regularly dusted with snow. The mountain range of &ldquo;Dientes de Navarino&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;teeth of Navarino&rdquo;), completes the dramatic backdrop. Originally used by the Yaghan people, a hunter-gatherer tribe, the area was abandoned by them upon the arrival of European settlers.The current city was established as a naval base in 1953; its name honours the British-Chilean naval commander John Williams Wilson of the 16th century. Initially protecting territorial possessions and fishing rights in the area, as well as offering logistical support to Antarctic bases, it has now become a departure point for scientific and tourist trips to the Antarctic region. Puerto Williams charms the visitor with a small village feel, complete with rustic buildings and a homely smell of drifting wood smoke.

Converging warm and cool ocean currents attract some spectacular animal life to the passage. Your arrival in Antarctica will see skyscraper sized icebergs salute you, in a land where penguins and whales roam undisturbed through snow and ice.",,,,,,,Day 4,Antarctic Sound,"The Antarctic Sound will be one of your first encounters of this white kingdom, located at the northerly tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The Sound is an assault on the senses with imposing iceberg slabs that have broken away from the disintegrating Larsen Ice Shelf.

Before departure, you'll want to brush up on your photography skills to capture this magnificent continent in all of its unrestrained glory.

Unseen by humans until 1820, the peninsula offers the thrill of the truly unknown and extraordinary. It is sprinkled with research bases at the frontline of human scientific endeavour, their inhabitants dedicated to the study of a unique landscape, its exceptional wildlife, and the impact that humans are having on this pristine continent. Cathedral-sized icebergs will loom up close, blue-hued glaciers will slowly slip into view from imposing locations like Hope Bay and thousands of adorable Adelie penguin pairs are to be found thriving, undisturbed in this unique setting.",,,,,,Day 8,South Shetland Islands,"The South Shetland Islands lie close to the northwestern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, separated by the Bransfield Strait. Several countries maintain research bases here and with plump elephant seals, and crowds of gentoo, chinstrap and Adelie Penguins also calling the islands home, it can sometimes feel a little crowded! King George Island is the largest and hosts the majority of the research stations, some of which are populated all-year-round by small yet hardy crews. These islands offer extraordinary adventure in one of the most remote locations on Earth. Towering over the archipelago are the triple peaks of Mount Foster and you're bound to feel your heart pumping a little faster, as you sail into the centre of Deception Island's magnificent collapsed volcano caldera. Elephant Island, meanwhile, is written deep into the annals of Antarctic legend as the site where Ernest Shackleton and the stricken crew of the Endurance miraculously survived a harsh Antarctic winter, in 1916.",,,,,,Day 9,Drake Passage,"Crossing back into the Drake Passage you will relive the chance to navigate those legendary seas with albatros, petrels and dolphins for company.",,,,,,,,Day 10,Sailing around Cape Horn,"No two words conjured up more fear to sailors of the past than Cape Horn. A reputation for ferocious storms and mountainous seas, the cape was a place where a seafarer garnered respect for bravery against the odds. Once an unavoidable physical gateway to adventure and commerce in the Pacific Ocean, Cape Horn nowadays has more of a spiritual attraction. It draws intrepid travellers who wish to pay homage to the brave sailors who once risked their lives to pass this wild and inhospitable headland.When the weather is clear from the frequent icy squalls that batter the island's shores, a 23 feet (7m) high steel monument can be seen standing about 1 mile (1.5km) away from the true cape, near the Chilean navy station.

This location is closed during the early part of the wandering albatross breeding season - from November 20 to January 7. Fortuna Bay &ndash; Amongst beaches inhabited by penguins and seals, there is the chance to follow the final leg of Shackleton's route into the abandoned whaling village of Stromness. The path cuts across the mountain pass beyond Shackleton's Waterfall, and with swampy terrain, be prepared to cross a few small streams.Salisbury Plain, St. Andrews Bay, Gold Harbour &ndash; Not only are the three largest king penguin colonies in South Georgia to be found here, these sites are also home to three of the world's largest breeding beaches for Antarctic fur seals.

In the spring of 1916, he set off in a lifeboat, the James Caird, for South Georgia. As Elephant Island comes into view on the horizon, after crossing all of that water, it's hard not to marvel at how he and his five-man crew accomplished that incredible journey. Conditions on Elephant Island are severe; the 22 marooned members of Shackleton's Endurance Expedition miraculously survived here for four and a half months while Shackleton launched their rescue attempt. If possible you will take the zodiacs to Point Wild, to see vertical rock and ice cliffs highly exposed to the elements, where the crew survived waiting for Shackleton to return.",,,,,,Day 14,Antarctic Peninsula,"We will sail into the Antarctic Sound at the northwestern edge of the Weddell Sea, if ice permits.

There will be an opportunity to collect your luggage tags and confirm if you wish to join tour of Lake Escondido tomorrow. The team will also confirm details regarding embarkation day, answer any questions you may have and provide you with information on where to dine or make last minute purchases. The remainder of your time in Ushuaia is at your leisure; please note that any meals on Day 1 are at your own expense. ",,,,,,,Day 2,Embarkation,"After breakfast, you will need to check-out and ensure your cabin luggage is fitted with cabin tags that are clearly labelled with your name and cabin number. Take your luggage to your hotel reception; it will be stored and transferred directly to the port for clearance and then placed in your cabin ahead of your arrival onboard. Please keep any valuables or personal items you may need with you throughout the day. Your morning is free for you to explore Ushuaia, or you can join the full-day tour of Lake Escondido. Here, you will be driven through large glacial valleys and evergreen forests, past gushing waterfalls and rivers in the vast Andes Mountains. You will wind your way up through Garibaldi Pass, where you can take in incredible views of Lake Escondido and, if the weather permits, Fagnano Lake.Next, you will start your descent to reach Fagnano Lake's shore, where you will visit a local ranch and have the opportunity to sample a classic Fuegian lamb barbecue. At the end of the excursion, you will be taken to the port to board your ship. If you are not participating in the cruise, enjoy the day in Ushuaia and meet in the hotel lobby at 3:45 pm to be transferred to the pier for embarkation. Once onboard the vessel, there is time to settle into your cabin before important mandatory briefings. We gather on the deck as the ship pulls away from port, to commence an Antarctic adventure and enjoy spectacular views over Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego.  This evening get to know your fellow expeditioners and friendly expedition team and crew at a welcome dinner to celebrate the start of a thrilling adventure to Antarctica.",,,,,,,,,,,,Days 3 & 4,Drake Passage,"As we begin crossing the Drake Passage, it's time to get comfortable with the movement of the sea. Meanwhile, the expedition team will prepare you for the first landing in Antarctica with important wildlife guidelines and biosecurity procedures. The lecture programme also begins, helping you learn more about Antarctica's history, wildlife and environment. Out on deck there is an opportunity to enjoy watching and photographing the many seabirds that follow the vessel  including majestic albatrosses and giant petrels. On sea days, there is also chance to enjoy the facilities onboard including the gym, wellness centre and the relaxing observation lounges.  The excitement will be palpable on the afternoon of Day 4 as we draw close to the South Shetland Islands and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Everyone is likely to converge on one of the observation decks watching for the first iceberg. The ocean takes on a whole new perspective once the ship passes below the Antarctic Convergence; we will be surrounded by the surreal presence of floating ice sculptures and the memory of your first big iceberg sighting is likely to remain with you for a lifetime. Time and weather permitting, we may attempt our first landing in Antarctica by late afternoon. ",,,,,,,Days 5 to 10,Antarctic Peninsula & Antarctic Circle,"The feeling of arriving in Antarctica is almost impossible to describe: spotting that first iceberg and taking your first breaths of some of the freshest, crispest air on Earth are memories that will last forever. On arrival in Antarctica, the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands offer a whole host of opportunities to explore. We will be so far south that we will experience approximately 18-24 hours of daylight, so the days can be as busy as you wish.  The expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design the ideal voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing weather, ice conditions and wildlife opportunities. Generally there are landings or Zodiac excursions twice a day. You will want to wrap up warm before joining Zodiac cruises along spectacular ice cliffs or among grounded icebergs. Be sure to keep watch for whales, seals and porpoising penguins. Zodiacs will also transport you from the ship to land, to visit penguin rookeries, discover historic huts and explore some of the most iconic spots along the peninsula.  While ashore, you may choose to wander along pebbly beaches or perhaps up snow-covered ridgelines to vantage points with mountains towering overhead and ice-speckled oceans below. When conditions allow, any optional activities you have signed up for will be taking place, including a chance to fully immerse yourself in polar waters. The polar plunge can take place at any time during the voyage, depending on when conditions are right, so prepare to listen out for the announcement from the expedition team and get ready for the most exhilarating dip of your life!  We may cruise in the vessel, along some of the narrow, dramatic straits separating offshore islands from the mainland, or linger in scenic bays to watch whales travelling and feeding. This is a great time to use the observation lounge or even make your way to the bridge (open at the captain's discretion) for uninterrupted views of Antarctica in all its splendour. Listen out for the creak and deep rumble of glaciers as they calve; take a quiet moment to experience the wonder of the pristine paradise of the White Continent. On this voyage, we plan to cross the Antarctic Circle (with favourable conditions). This imaginary line is located at latitude 66&deg;33' south and is certainly a special highlight for many expeditioners. Where possible, the moment will be celebrated with a toast on deck and you will have earned some boasting privileges by joining a small group of lucky adventurers who have ventured to this part of the world. As we approach The Circle, subtle changes take place in the landscape and in the distribution of wildlife. The waters here at this time of year are rich with krill meaning we can hope to see plenty of whales, particularly humpbacks and minkes. We also hope to enjoy the spectacle of penguins feeding their ravenous chicks. ",,,,,,Days 11 & 12,The Scotia Sea,"On our way to South Georgia, we will sail across the Scotia Sea. This follows the route that explorer Ernest Shackleton and five of his men took in order to find help for the rest of their abandoned crew at Elephant Island. On 24 April 1916, Shackleton and his men piled into the James Caird, the most seaworthy of their lifeboats, to attempt a perilous journey to South Georgia, some 802 miles or 1,290 kms away. Shackleton hoped to reach South Georgia in two weeks. There he would enlist the help of local whalers and return to Elephant Island to rescue the men who had been left behind.  With excitement building for arrival to South Georgia, pass the time by catching up with fellow expeditioners in the bar, keep a close watch for marine wildlife, or perhaps hear more tales of Shackleton's story from our historian. ",,,,,,Days 13 to 17,Exploring South Georgia,"As the vessel approaches the rugged island of South Georgia, spare a thought for Captain James Cook, who arrived here in 1775 and believed it to be the northern tip of a great southern continent. In fact, it is just a small island only 110 miles (176 kms) long. South Georgia is, however an island of incredible riches. It has a 9,842ft (3,000 m) snow-capped mountain range, some of the world's largest congregations of wildlife and a truly fascinating human history.From the sea, jagged mountain peaks rise steeply, while seabirds are often spotted soaring around the ship. We will sail along the coast, taking in the spectacular glaciated scenery and the enchanting coastline is yours to explore. Be sure to layer up before joining Zodiac cruises around craggy coves and along the rocky coastline in search of porpoising penguins, seal haul-outs and bird cliffs. Keep an eye out for South Georgia's kelp forests: remarkable underwater ecosystems which are quite mesmerising as their fronds sway back and forth on the water's surface.  Zodiacs will shuttle you to shore, where you can visit some of the largest king penguin colonies on Earth and take a guided walk among fur seals and elephant seals (making sure you listen to your guides and keep your distance). Wander along pebbled streams and grassy glacial outwash plains and visit the remnants of South Georgia's thriving whaling stations. There is time to pay respects to Sir Ernest Shackleton, whose incredible voyage of survival is synonymous with this island. If you have chosen any optional activities, there will be the option to do that whenever conditions allow.  We may cruise in the vessel through fjords with towering cliffs of ancient stone, or into deeply indented bays towards dramatic glacier fronts. Make your way to the ship's bridge or find a comfy spot in the observation lounge to enjoy uninterrupted views of South Georgia's majestic coast.",,,,,,Days 18 to 20,At Sea,"We sail towards the Falkland Islands (Las Malvinas), and there is still plenty to keep you occupied on board. The expedition team will continue to share their wealth of knowledge about wildlife, history and the natural world as part of the onboard lecture series. You will have time to enjoy observing seabirds from the stern of the ship and keep a close watch for whales and other marine wildlife.",,,,,,,,Day 21,Falkland Islands,"The Falkland Islands (Las Malvinas) comprise two large islands (East and West Falkland), with over 700 more islands scattered off the coast. All but seven of these are uninhabited and these beautifully barren islands are true wildlife havens. With windswept coastlines, white sand beaches and crystal-clear water, they shelter an impressive diversity of birdlife, including the largest black-browed albatross colony on Earth. The cold, nutrient-rich waters surrounding the islands also make this a prime location for spotting marine life. There are many beautiful areas to explore across this area, each offering a unique perspective on this magnificent archipelago. We plan to land in Stanley, the historic capital of the Falklands. A charming town with a distinctly British character: terraced town houses, pioneer cottages and even an iconic red telephone box! Colourful buildings house cosy cafes, English pubs, souvenir shops, a post office and the fascinating Historic Dockyard Museum. This museum has displays on the maritime history of the Falkland Islands, local natural history and links to Antarctica. ",,,,,,Day 22,At Sea,"As we set sail to return to Ushuaia, you may choose to spend your time editing photos, enjoying the ship's facilities, or attend any final lectures on offer onboard. With newfound friends, celebrate the end of an unforgettable voyage at a special Captain's farewell dinner.  There is still plenty of time to enjoy the magic of the Southern Ocean and the life that calls it home and time for reflection and discussion about what we have seen and experienced. We hope you become ambassadors for the Antarctic region, telling your family, friends and colleagues about your journey to this magical place, advocating for its conservation and preservation so that they might one day visit the region to experience what you have been lucky enough to see and do here.  ",,,,,,Day 23,Disembarkation,"Early this morning, we cruise up the Beagle Channel, before quietly slipping into dock in Ushuaia, where we disembark around 0800. Say farewell to your expedition team and fellow passengers as you continue your onward journey, hopefully with a newfound sense of the immense power of nature.   On disembarkation, passengers on flights departing prior to 1400 will be transferred directly to Ushuaia Airport, while those fortunate enough to be continuing their travels in this spectacular region of the world will be transferred to post-voyage Ushuaia accommodation. Passengers flying after 1400 will have time to explore Ushuaia before an afternoon airport transfer, details of which will be provided onboard prior to disembarkation.

You'll embark the ship in the afternoon, sailing into the mountain-fringed Beagle Channel.",,,,,,,Days 2 & 3,At Sea,"During your first two days at sea you'll make your way through the Drake Passage, feeling the cool salt breeze as the rolling sea below hums, occasionally met with a spout of sea spray courtesy of a fin whale. You'll reach the circum-Antarctic upwelling zone after passing the Antarctic Convergence: Antarctica's natural boundary, formed when north-flowing cold waters collide with warmer Sub-Antarctic seas. Both the marine and avian life change; look out for wandering albatrosses, grey-headed albatrosses, black-browed albatrosses, light-mantled sooty albatrosses, cape pigeons, southern fulmars, Wilson's storm petrels, blue petrels, and Antarctic petrels.",,,,,,,,,,,,Days 4 to 7,Antarctica,"Your journey to the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula will navigate through the huge tabular icebergs that populate the Antarctic Sound. As you reach the Weddell Sea, the search for the emperor penguins begins. You will explore by both vessel and helicopter to maximise your chances of finding these elusive birds. You might also enjoy scenic flights, and if conditions allow, helicopter landings in otherwise inaccessible locations. Possible landings include: The west slopes of the Antarctic Sound: The western side of this area is only rarely seen from the air, though the landscape is truly worth the flight: layered sandstones, lava flows, glaciers, icebergs, and pack-ice extend as far as the eye can see. There are often individual emperor penguins and Adelie penguins on the ice floes, as well as kelp gulls, skuas, and various breeds of petrel. Jagged mountain peaks stab through the snow, and enormous walls of ice lie shattered on the slopes below. Duse Bay: A soaring helicopter flight may deposit you on a rocky hillock close to an old refuge hut overlooking this bay. There's still a lot of snow and ice this time of year, but much of the walk in this location is over frost-shattered rock covered with lichen of all shapes and colours. Seymour Island: This is where the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901 to 1904 wintered under harrowing polar conditions. Today, you'll see impressive sedimentary rock, fossils, and expansive views. If conditions allow for deeper ventures into the Weddell Sea, zodiac trips may include: Devil Island: Home to a large colony of Adelie penguins, this island offers a magnificent vantage point for hikers willing to foot it to the top of the hill. Melting ice sometimes forms a waterfall dropping from the cliffs close to Cape Well-met. Brown Bluff: Maybe the most scenic location in the entire northern tip of the Antarctic Continent:  sheer canyon walls, fallen boulders, beautiful volcanic creations capped with ice. A large Adelie penguin rookery lives here, with gentoo penguins and nesting snow petrels also to be found. Gourdin Island: Chinstrap, gentoo, and Adelie penguins love this island, which is yet another landing option for your continuing Antarctic adventure.Esperanza Base: This Argentine research station, which operates year-round and is one of only two civilian settlements in Antarctica, could serve as an alternative landing site.",,,,,,,Days 5 & 6,Alternative options,"If the route to Snow Hill Island is free of multi-year pack ice the ship will attempt to visit the emperor penguin colonies there by helicopter. The flight to the landing point takes approximately 15 minutes and from there it is a 45 minute walk to the penguin rookery. The helicopter capacity is 4 to 6 passengers per flight. A short period at the rookery is required to allow for all passengers to share this unique experience. Please be aware that safe helicopter operations are extremely sensitive to changing weather conditions. Based on data from the previous 8 voyages, there is around a 50% probability that the Snow Hill Island visit will be able to proceed. If it is not possible to visit, the ship will look for alternative opportunities, including positioning near the ice edge to look for emperors heading out to open water.

The crossing is known for its potentially lively conditions, though the purpose-built X-bow design of your ship will help slice through the waves, reducing some of the pitching. Your time in the Drake Passage will be spent preparing for your arrival into Antarctica, as well as enjoying soaring birds gliding past the ship. You will be briefed on how to stay safe and minimize your impact on this precious wilderness, as well as talking through how your time will be spent exploring, including hints and tips for wildlife watching. The Expedition Team of naturalist guides will be kickstarting the educational side of your trip with fascinating presentations on topics such as wildlife, geology, glaciology, history, and more.  Once you have arrived in Antarctic waters, the ship may head straight down towards the Antarctic Circle (adding another day at sea before your first landing) - the decision will depend on weather and ice conditions.

The ship's exact routing will be subject to careful planning by the Expedition Leader and Captain, but the overriding objective is to visit a range of sites which showcase the best of this jaw-dropping region. During your time exploring Antarctica you will head out on Zodiac cruises to marvel at the vast, sculptural icebergs and crumbling glaciers. On shore, watch quietly as penguins waddle past en route from their chaotic rookeries to fish for krill, or hike up to ridgepoints for stunning views out across the endless icy mountains. Spend time out on deck as the ship squeezes through ice-riddled channels, and look out for the distinctive blow of passing whales.

",,,,,,Days 6 to 10,Weddell Sea & Quest to Land at Snow Hill,"The journey toward Snow Hill Island will put you in explorer mode as the Captain and Expedition Leader keep you updated through weather briefings, meteorological and sea ice condition reports. The thickness of ice will determine how close Ultramarine can get to Snow Hill Island, then the twin-engine helicopters will take over.Like summitting a mountain from base camp, if safe conditions allow, parties will set out from the ship towards the emperor penguin colony. Your adventure begins with an extended helicopter transfer that will reveal a landscape of snow-capped peaks and apartment building-sized tabular icebergs. The rookery itself is located on the sea ice off the south coast of Snow Hill Island and the landing will be as close to the penguins as possible, yet at a safe distance to avoid disturbing the birds. Upon landing, your party will walk across the ice to the emperor penguin colony. The excitement builds as you walk next to paths in the snow carved by penguins that came before. And then there are the incredible sounds of the penguins in the distance as you march toward one of the rarest wildlife opportunities on the planet: the colony of thousands and thousands of rarely-seen emperor penguins.The goal of the expedition is to get every guest to the remote rookery once during the course of the trip. The expedition team and special experts will be close by to answer your questions and ensure you take in everything there is to see. You'll observe close up how the emperor penguins behave as a tight-knit community, how they care for their young, and how they body surf across the ice in a way that can only be described as quirky yet efficient. And while at base on the ship with your knowledgeable expedition team, you'll be immersed each day in the polar experience of the Weddell Sea. Daily activities will include Zodiac cruising among the icebergs, adventuring and learning while atop the ice, optional paddle-on-top kayaking (additional cost, pre-booking strongly recommended), or working with the ship's team to observe the weather forecasting and ship operations up close.A particularly enriching component of your voyage will be the bespoke educational programs tailored specifically for this expedition that offer both traditional (lecture format) and hands-on opportunities for learning about this fascinating region. Each day our polar experts, who include penguin scientists, biologists and polar historians, will present on various aspects of emperor penguins and their behaviors, ice formations such as the tabular icebergs which you'll see from the deck of your ship, and the experiences of polar explorers who braved the Weddell Sea over a century ago. Or you might, on one of these days, decide to take the polar plunge, or test your balance on a stand-up paddleboard (optional activity at additional cost, pre-booking strongly recommended). Then again, maybe you'll enjoy a little pampering. If so, you can choose from your vessel's excellent onboard amenities, including the spa, sauna and fitness room.The emperor penguin colony at Snow Hill is the goal of this expedition. However, if unfavourable weather or ice conditions prevent the expedition from visiting the colony entirely or shorten the duration of the visit, you may explore some other locations instead. Your possible alternative landings in Antarctica will take place on the eastern side of the Peninsula, which is an extension of the Transantarctic Mountains and is the most northern stretch of Antarctic land. Below are some of the landing sites you may explore in the area.Brown Bluff: An immense cliff of volcanic rock, towers 2,225ft (678m) over rookeries of Ad&eacute;lie and gentoo penguins, some of which will be incubating their eggs.Devil Island: The Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901-04 discovered the narrow island, which is 1 mile (1.6 km) long and has a low summit at each end.Hope Bay: Three members of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition (1901-04) spent the winter in a hut on the shores of Hope Bay. The hut is located close to the jetty of Esperanza Station, an Argentine research station.Paulet Island: Located in the northwestern Weddell Sea, Paulet Island is home to a large Ad&eacute;lie penguin rookery. With a volcanic cone that rises 1,158ft (353m), the island reminds you that this was once a very active landscape. In addition to penguins, you may be interested in visiting a historic hut built by members of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901-04. A cross marks the gravesite of crew member Ole Wennersgaard.Seymour Island: Northeast of Snow Hill Island is a smaller island that was originally mistaken for a cape. Seymour Island is significant for fossil finds and for the remains of the KT Boundary, which marks the transition between the Cretaceous Period (dinosaurs and reptiles) and the Tertiary Period (mammals) of geological times. This era is known for the mass extinction of many forms of life, including dinosaurs.

While exploring the Antarctic Peninsula, there may be opportunities each day to walk or kayak among the ice floes and experience close encounters with wildlife. You may have the thrill of watching your powerful ship crunch through the pack ice, or step ashore to thousands of gentoo penguins. You'll learn how climate change affects the penguin populations, and how best to capture images of these delightful birds. Back aboard, the ship's undersea footage specialist may present video from that day's dive or show rare images taken up to 1,000 feet below the surface using the unique ROV submersible.

Always interesting, with few human visitors it can also be pioneering in this distant part of the world. ",,,,,,Days 18 to 25,Exploring the Ross Sea,"On these days, as you explore the Ross Sea, you will be navigating through some of the most remote regions of the planet; just like Scott, Shackleton, and Ross, the 19th-century explorer for whom this sea is named. Here, you will see the impressive Ross Ice Shelf, the world's largest, and the Transantarctic Mountain Chain. Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf is enormous, covering 182,000 square miles - the size of France - and the edge of the ice shelf is a wall of ice towering over the water by as much as 200 feet, with the majority of the ice below the waterline. The Ross Ice Shelf plays an important role in stabilizing the Antarctic ice sheet, buttressing the ice that is constantly moving over the land's surface.Your journey to this unique part of the Antarctic waters will likely include stops at several small islands at the bottom of the world for opportunities to go ashore and explore via Zodiac and kayak.

Keeping a flexible weather-dependent schedule, the plan is to explore several intriguing islands. Two small rocky islands: North East and Broughton, comprise The Snares, the closest sub-Antarctic islands to New Zealand. The islands are covered with heavy tussock grass and wind-beaten forests of tree daisies. The Snares are home to huge numbers of breeding birds: the 99 recorded species include albatross, Antarctic terns and Snares crested penguins. The Auckland Islands are the largest of New Zealand's subantarctic islands, with the richest flora, prolific birdlife and an interesting human history. Conditions permitting, you may cruise in Zodiacs to Enderby Island to view a large New Zealand sea lion colony with pups all jostling for position.

Home to five different species of penguin, including king penguins, you will also find huge albatrosses here.  Enjoy sweeping landscapes, littered with shipwrecks and colourful wildflowers. A warm welcome from the human residents is guaranteed, especially when the local custom of smoko is served up - towering platters of cakes and biscuits with tea and coffee. Things haven't always been so peaceful here, however, and you may be able to pay a visit to the battlefields and memorials of the costly war in 1982, when the British and Argentinians clashed fiercely over these islands.Another potential landing site may be at wind-lashed West Point Island. Here you'll be welcomed ashore by the calls and cries of a huge colony of black-browed albatross. Indeed, the island was originally known as Albatross Island before being renamed to reflect its geographic location. The scattering of humans and sheep are outweighed by a huge army of birdlife; look out for the rockhopper penguins who scamper and burrow along the coast's boulders, as well as the imperial cormorants who rest here in great numbers. You may also spot Magellanic penguins during your explorations. Hike the island's quiet landscapes, and look out for endemic plants like Felton's flower carpeting the green interior. Cliff Mountain is the island's standout - a towering sandstone monolith, and the archipelago's highest cliff, falling away to swirling waves below where you might find Commerson's dolphins at play. This is also a good location to look out for whales and as well as fur seals.",,,,,,Day 4,"Port Stanley, Falkland Islands","Today you may visit Stanley, where you may find the odd pub serving ales and even fish and chips. While iconic landmarks such as Christ Church Cathedral, with its whalebone arch are 100% local, there is also a good smattering of imported garden gnomes and Union Jacks.The islands' ownership has long been a matter of controversy, ever since colonisation in the 18th Century. At various points in their life the islands have been considered French, British, Spanish and Argentine. Following the Falklands War in 1982 the islands remain part of the British Commonwealth today.  Margaret Thatcher, under whom the war was masterminded, remains something of a local hero, reflected in the street signs (such as Thatcher Drive). For those who want to dig deeper into the past, the Historic Docklands Museum provides lots of information on the chequered historical and political background of the Falklands.

Here you'll witness a cacophony of calling birds, with crowds of colourful king penguins stretching out as far as the eye can see. An overseas territory of the UK, these isolated, subantarctic islands once formed a remote whaling centre - and you can still visit the haunting former whaling stations. Nowadays the giants of the sea are free to cruise the icy waters uninhibited with some populations beginning to recover. Fans of Ernest Shackleton's tale of Antarctic exploration, shipwreck and survival will know that the Endurance's crew were saved when he reached the salvation of South Georgia's shores in 1916 - before returning to collect the remaining sailors from desolate Elephant Island. A museum commemorates the legendary mission, and you can see the memorial to Shackleton that stands over his final resting place on this fabled island. South Georgia's vast colonies of king penguins - with vivid bursts of yellow and orange around their necks - stand, squabble and curiously investigate, enjoying the isolated respite of this island.

The vast peninsula is sprinkled with research bases, which are at the front line of human scientific endeavour, pushing to study and understand this unique landscape, its exceptional wildlife and the impact that humans are having on this pristine continent. Witness cathedral-sized icebergs up close, and blue-hued glaciers, slowly slipping from imposing locations like Hope Bay. Blanched mountain peaks cover the peninsula, and you'll find thousands of adorable penguins thriving undisturbed in this unique setting.",,,,,,Day 16,Fly out of King George Island,"As the largest of all the South Shetland Islands, King George is considered the gateway to and from Antarctica. At just 75 miles (120 kilometres) from the Antarctic Peninsula and the only airport in the South Shetlands, it is the connection between &ldquo;real life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Antarctic life&rdquo;. More than 10 different nations have year-round or summer-only scientific research stations on the island; considering that 90% of the island is covered by snow and ice, that is quite an achievement! Maintaining a base on the island allows membership of the Antarctic Treaty. There is even a Russian Orthodox church, with a permanent on-site priest. The island was named for King George III after a British explorer discovered it in 1819. Since then the island has been claimed by both Chile (1940) and Argentina (1943), but remains part of British Antarctic Territory.The island is home to a simple airstrip, which is the landing location for your flight out of Antarctica and back to Chile. This takes approximately two hours and cuts out two days' sailing across the notorious Drake Passage. Please note that flight schedules are always subject to safe weather conditions.

As well as spectacular wildlife and scenery, the islands are also a fantastic location to stretch your legs, and the expedition team will often organise various walking options ranging from gentle strolling to faster-paced hiking. The Falklands offer an incredible juxtaposition, with penguins waddling around Caribbean-like white sand beaches framed by the intense yellow gorse flowers. The strange contrasts continue, with grazing sheep ambling past noisy rockhopper penguin rookeries. Overhead, the huge wingspans of black-browed albatross fill the air - a photographer's dream as they cruise in to land at their nesting site.

Between lectures, head outside - these rich waters can be an excellent place to catch sight of seabirds from the deck. Scan the sky for soaring albatross such as the comically faced light-mantled albatross and curious giant petrels, then check the sea for any spouts of passing whales. This is also the ideal time to immerse yourself in a book from the ship's reference library, or spend time in the Bridge seeing the team of Officers in action.

With an increasing number of mega icebergs breaking off from Antarctic ice shelves and breaking up in South Georgian waters, the ship will navigate carefully through these hulking ice sculptures, many of which dwarf the vessel and provide endless photographic moments.  You may land at the rusting remains of Grytviken whaling station to visit legendary explorer Ernest Shackleton's grave - take a moment to toast The Boss with a dram of whisky. The small museum has an excellent, though chilling, account of the station's bloody past. Those looking for souvenirs are well served at the small museum shop and can also mail postcards home from the charming Post Office - the unique stamps here are a philatelists' dream!Of course, South Georgia is best known for its jaw-dropping wildlife, with the sheer density of penguins and seals leading some to dub it the &ldquo;Serengeti of the South&rdquo;. Against a backdrop of jagged mountains and lush green tussac grass, the sound of thousands of king penguins calling carries through the air. As landings can sometimes be complicated here, exploring by zodiac allows you to get spectacular photographic compositions, with huge elephant seal bulls patrolling the foreground, king penguins anxiously trying to make their way through a blubbery battlefield to reach their nesting grounds immediately behind. Giant petrels and skuas are constantly on the prowl, looking for scavenging opportunities and there is so much activity it can be hard to know where to point your lens. Conditions can change rapidly, from glaring sun to driving snow, rain and even fog banks occluding and then revealing the mountains in an instant.  Make sure to bring plenty of memory cards and spare batteries as this is one of the planet's most photogenic locations!",,,,,,Days 12 to 14,At sea,"Bidding South Georgia farewell, there's time to start sorting through your thousands of photos. However, your team of naturalist guides will continue to share their knowledge and stories about the region's rich wildlife and history. By this point, you are sure to have become well acquainted with the glass-enclosed observation lounge, the ideal place for wildlife spotting in the warmth. Enjoy watching passing seabirds taking advantage of the ship's thermal updrafts. But to warm up even more, rest weary bones in the sizzling heat of the onboard sauna. ",,,,,,Day 15,Back to the Falkland Islands,"You will return to the Falklands for one more day of exploration, and potentially the chance to get your final penguin fix. Keep your eyes peeled for moments to capture the iconic bouncing of rockhopper penguins on the move, and look out for Magellanic penguins burrowing near the beach. This can be a good location to spot imperial cormorants, along with ponds teeming with Chiloe wigeon, steamer ducks, teals and grebes. On the shoreline, the southern sea lions may be arriving to haul out and both Peale's and Commerson's dolphins are sometimes sighted. ",,,,,,,,Day 16,At sea,"Sailing from Stanley, you will journey back to Punta Arenas. Your expedition team will continue with their absorbing programme of talks and it's a prime opportunity to check wildlife identifications for any of your photos. There will also be ample time to chat with your fellow travellers about the once-in-a-lifetime trip you have just experienced - as the ship is limited to just 96 passengers, tight-knit friendships are often formed within a group of like-minded wildlife lovers.

There is some excellently preserved Victorian and Edwardian architecture, set against the picturesque backdrop of the Silver Peaks hinterland. Within the city you can find the Otago Peninsula, home to wildlife reserves including the only mainland breeding colony of northern royal albatrosses.",,,,,,,Day 2,At sea en route to Campbell Island,"Today, you will sail south to Campbell Island. The expedition team of naturalist guides will use your sea days to provide an insightful programme of educational presentations on the wildlife and history of the locations you will visit.

Colloquially known as &ldquo;megaherbs&rdquo;, these lush plants are characterised by their impressive size, with huge leaves and brightly colourful flowers. The island's other great draw is its glorious birdlife. It is home to several critically endangered endemic birds, including the Campbell Island teal and snipe, along with an impressive six albatross species.During your time on the island, you may have the opportunity to undertake a guided walk on the Col Lyell Saddle boardwalk, as well as explore the coastline of Perseverance Harbour by zodiac cruise.

Treat yourself to a pampering session in the spa, or burn off the delicious food in the well-equipped gym. ",,,,,,Days 7 to 14,Exploring the Ross Sea of Antarctica,"You will spend the next week navigating the southernmost sea in the world. This extremely remote body of water is named after a Royal Navy Officer, Sir James Clark Ross, a naturalist who first explored the region in 1841 with HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. The sea is bounded on the east by Roosevelt Island and the Edward VII Peninsula in Mary Byrd Land, on the west by Ross Island and the coastal mountains of Victoria Land, and south by the spectacular Ross Ice Shelf, the largest in Antarctica. The conditions here can be extremely wild, with both the weather and ice dictating your daily itinerary. Your Captain and Expedition Leader will look for the best opportunities for you to safely explore the area.Possible locations include Cape Adare, at the northern end of the Borchgrevink coast, home to the world's largest colony of Adelie penguins. The ship may also attempt to reach Terra Nova Bay. South of this location is the spectacular Drygalski Ice Tongue. Thought to be over 4,000 years old, it extends 43 miles (70 km) offshore from the David Glacier and is an impressive 15 miles (24 km) across at its widest point. If possible, you might take in some of Antarctica's most famous historical monuments. You may head to Inexpressible Island, where a group of six men from the Terra Nova expedition, led by Robert Falcon Scott (1910-1913), were forced to winter through brutal conditions in a cave dug in the ice. On Ross Island, if conditions allow, you might discover the legendary Sir Ernest Shackleton's hut. Built at Cape Royds at the foot of Mount Erebus, it was erected for the British Nimrod expedition (1907-1909). While in search of the South Magnetic Pole 60 years earlier, Captain James Ross discovered Franklin Island, named for the famous Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. This is a fantastic location to spot Adelie penguins, as well as beautifully pelted Weddell seals snoozing on the shore. ",,,,,,Days 15 to 18,At sea,"Turning north once again, you will head towards Macquarie Island. This is a perfect opportunity to start sorting through your photos and immersing yourself in the ship's luxurious amenities. During sailing time, your onboard naturalists will continue to provide fascinating talks on the history and wildlife of the area.  ",,,,,,Day 19,Exploring Macquarie Island,"Despite measuring just 21 miles (34 km) by 3 (5km), Macquarie Island is an island of outstanding natural diversity. More than 3.5 million seabirds breed here, most of which are four species of penguin: royals, kings, gentoos and rockhoppers. There are also three types of fur seals and an impressive seventh of the world's population of elephant seals breed here. If time and weather permit, there may be the opportunity to land ashore and view the jaw-dropping wildlife that calls this island home. ",,,,,,,,Day 20,At sea en route to the Snares,"Sailing north, you will make a final stop on your expedition before returning to New Zealand.",,,,,,Day 21,Zodiac cruising around the Snares,"A remarkable haven for wildlife, the Snares contain more nesting seabirds than the entirety of the British Islands. This is partly thanks to having avoided any human introduction of invasive mammals, such as mice and rats. Over 2 million Sooty Shearwaters breed here in the summer months, joined by four species of albatross. You may add to your penguin species list if you spot one of the 35,000 endemic Snares crested penguins. Also look out for fur seals and sea lions hauled out on the beaches. Please note that landing on the Snares is prohibited. If conditions allow, the expedition team will offer a zodiac cruise to enjoy the spectacular coastline.

Here, where the world's coldest waters meet, gargantuan ice sculptures float on the sea and serve up your first real glimpse of the White Continent. If the Captain has made good progress, and the weather is calm enough, by late afternoon you might even set foot on Antarctica for the very first time. ",,,,,,,Days 5 to 9,Exploring the Weddell Sea and Antarctica Peninsula,"Once you arrive on the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with five full days of between 18 to 24 sunlight to spend taking in the continent, the excursions will begin in earnest. The experts in your expedition team, who have collectively experienced hundreds of polar expeditions, will use their knowledge to create an adaptable itinerary. They'll curate the best options depending on the ever-changing weather and ice, as well as any opportunities to spot wildlife. Landings or zodiac excursions are generally attempted twice a day. Bundle up before entering a sturdy rib boat to cruise past immense ice cliffs or among grounded icebergs. You might be lucky enough to have a visitor - close encounters with seals and penguins are far from uncommon. Zodiacs will also take you from ship to land, where you can watch the goings-on of busy penguin rookeries and explore huts abandoned by explorers from bygone times.Activities may also include treks along pebbled shorelines or up snow-strewn peaks to peer out over the ice-studded waters below. If you have booked an optional activity, such as kayaking or snorkelling, you'll get the chance to immerse yourself in the water when conditions allow. A chance to brave the polar plunge is also usually woven into the itinerary. As well as zodiac cruises and shore excursions, you may cruise by ship through slender straits splitting offshore islands from the mainland or stop a while in scenic bays to witness whales gorging on the krill-rich waters. This is an excellent time to head to the Bridge for far-reaching views of Antarctica in all its glory. Stop to listen and you may even hear the thunderous noise of a glacier in the distance as it calves from atop a mountain and tumbles into the sea. Infamous for trapping Sir Ernest Shackleton's Endurance vessel in its icy clutches, the Weddell Sea is a bucket-list destination for polar explorers. Its gateway is the Antarctic Sound, a petite archipelago flanking the Peninsula's eastern side. Conditions allowing, the aim is to sail through this alley of icebergs, where these colossal structures attempt to battle their way north. Navigation can be a challenge even for the deftest of Captains, but it also makes for some astounding views.  As for wildlife, the Weddell Sea plays host to a thriving Adelie rookery on a small volcanic island where penguins jostle for space with a large colony of Antarctic blue-eyed shags jostling and nest-building Wilson's storm petrels. As your Captain moves deftly around the sea ice, look out for the bubbling of chinstrap and gentoo penguins porpoising in the water, or the slow movement of a humpback whale gliding through the depths. ",,,,,,Days 10 & 11,Returning via the Drake Passage,"One last foray to the South Shetland Islands is planned on your final morning in Antarctica before you sail back over the Drake Passage with sights set on South America once again. Onboard, immersive lectures and film presentations will continue to educate you on Antarctica. Let your memories of the past week settle and share discussions about your awe-inspiring encounters with newfound friends. We also advise you to steal some last moments out on deck, taking in the grandeur of the Southern Ocean.  As you near the bottom of South America, weather dependent, your Captain might even grant you a glimpse of the legendary Cape Horn - the ideal finale to your remarkable adventure. ",,,,,,Day 12,Arrival in Ushuaia,"As your Antarctic adventure concludes, your ship will cruise through the Beagle Channel, arriving in Ushuaia for disembarkation at around 8 am. You'll be ready to continue your journey onwards or home after bidding farewell to your fellow explorers and the dedicated onboard team.If you plan to explore South America more, a group transfer will whisk you to Ushuaia's downtown area. Those with an afternoon flight will be taken directly to the local airport. We recommend scheduling any plane journeys after 12pm in case of any delays.

Located at the foot of South America, this destination is often referred to as the &ldquo;End of the World&rdquo;. This is where you'll embark on your ship in the late afternoon and sail across the mountain-shrouded Beagle Channel for the rest of the evening. Please arrive in Ushuaia the day before Day 1 to allow for smooth embarkation. At Swoop, we would be delighted to assist with any hotel and excursion bookings in Ushuaia. ",,,,,,,Days 2 & 3,En route to South Georgia,"During these days at sea, your vessel will cross the Antarctic Convergence, where the temperature dips within just a few hours. Colliding columns of water push nutrients to the surface, attracting many species of seabirds - from albatrosses and shearwaters to petrels, prions and skuas. This will give you a small taste of what is to come on South Georgia, a remote island known as the &ldquo;Serengeti of the South&rdquo; because of its sheer concentration of incredible wildlife. ",,,,,,,,,,,,Days 4 to 6,South Georgia journey,"As you enter one of Earth's largest swathes of protected waters, you'll pass Shag Rocks, which thousands of South Georgia shags call home. Look out for larger marine mammals such as humpback whales here too, drawn to the rich feeding grounds of the shallow South Georgia Ridge. Next on the agenda are some of South Georgia's iconic sites, which could include Fortuna Bay. This scenic plain, washed out by the Fortuna Glacier, teems with king penguins and seals. Here, if conditions allow, you might have the opportunity to trace the finale of legendary polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's route to the abandoned whaling village of Stromness. As this path slices across the mountain pass beyond Shackleton's Waterfall, and has swampy terrain, be prepared to walk through a handful of small streams.Other potential stop-off points on South Georgia include Salisbury Plain, St Andrews Bay and Gold Harbour. These sites are home to the three biggest king penguin colonies on the island and also lay claim to the world's largest breeding beaches for Antarctic fur seals. Millions breed here in high season, and by the time February rolls around, adorable young fur seals splash through the surf while huge elephant seals haul out to moult. At the rusting remnants of Grytviken, one of the island's best-preserved whaling stations, you may stop to peruse the thought-provoking maritime exhibition in the South Georgia Museum. You may also head to the nearby cemetery to visit Shackleton's grave, to pay a whisky tributes to &lsquo;The Boss,' as he was affectionately called by his crew. As Day 6 ends, weather permitting, your ship will begin to sail towards the South Sandwich Islands.Please note that the ship's helicopters aren't allowed to fly in or around South Georgia. ",,,,,,,Days 7 & 8,Sea days,"Just like Shackleton in December 1914 on his notorious Endurance Expedition, you'll depart South Georgia and set off towards the Weddell Sea.Potential sea ice encounters mean that these waters can be challenging to navigate. Yet the journey will be far from lonely. Keep your eyes peeled for south polar skuas and snow petrels joining the flock of seabirds trailing the ship as you venture further south.",,,,,,Day 9,South Sandwich Islands,"While you can't leave the ship and explore on shore here, a zodiac cruise amid the mesmerising landscape will be planned.There will be a high chance of encountering humpback and minke whales in these rich feeding grounds. As you watch out for marine mammals, let yourself be distracted now and again by brown skuas and grey-headed, black-browed or even wandering albatrosses soaring through the skies. You might also spot chinstrap or Adelie penguins as you near land. ",,,,,,Days 10 to 12,Heading south,"During these few days, your ship will sail toward the extremely remote Queen Maud Land and Neuschwabenland (New Swabia) on the Antarctic continent, the northeast side of the Weddell Sea. Make the most of the vessel's program of educational lectures led by the Antarctic experts in the expedition team and spend time out on deck looking for wildlife as you sail. ",,,,,,Days 13 & 14,Neuschwabenland (New Swabia),"New Swabia will be your first planned destination in Antarctica, an area explored by Germany's Third Reich on the cusp of the Second World War. While attempting to claim the region during this dark time in history, foot soldiers placed Nazi flags on the sea ice while survey flights airdropped swastika-covered aluminium arrows. This area of Antarctica is extremely remote and very rarely visited by expedition ships. ",,,,,,,,Day 24,Exploring the Antarctic Sound,"As you head into the beautiful landscapes of the Antarctic Sound, you might stop off at one of the most scenic destinations on this side of the Antarctic Continent. An enormous Adelie penguin colony, along with gentoo penguins and nesting snow petrels, are also to be found in this area. Photographers will delight in the challenge of capturing Brown Bluff's impossibly steep canyon walls, haphazard boulders and ice-capped scenery. Kinnes Cove, where you can admire the light-red shades of the Madder Cliffs, also sits just across the Antarctic Sound. ",,,,,,Day 25,Legendary Elephant Island,"History buffs will be pleased to approach the point where Shackleton left to seek rescue for his 22 men, stranded after his Endurance ship sank in the Weddell Sea. In a tiny lifeboat, he and five others set sail for South Georgia and then hiked for 36 hours to the busy whaling station at Stromness. From start to end, it took 4.5 months to complete this legendary rescue.It's extremely difficult to safely land on Elephant Island as the coastline consists of vertical rock and highly exposed ice cliffs, making the Endurance crew's survival even more impressive. However, if conditions allow it, you'll take a zodiac to view Point Wild, where the deserted members of Shackleton's expedition waited for rescue. ",,,,,,Days 26 & 27,Sea days,"While crossing the Drake Passage, you might spot some of the same wildlife seen at the beginning of your trip: albatrosses, petrels and perhaps even the distant blows of passing whales. This is the perfect time to reflect on your adventures and sort through photos, as well as continuing the educational program laid on by your expedition team.  ",,,,,,Day 28,"Disembarkation in Ushuaia, Argentina","On this final day, your epic voyage comes to a close.

Established by British explorers in 1765, the Falklands brims with distinctive landscapes, including a coastline littered by rockhopper, gentoo and even small king penguin rookeries. Keep an eye out for the pillar-shaped nests of black browed albatrosses too, as well as nine of the archipelago's 14 endemic plants, such as silvery buttercup and hairy daisy. These remote islands have such a minuscule human population - penguins outnumber people here! The Falklands are also a haven for fur seals, Commerson's dolphins and imperial cormorants.

However, there's still plenty to do as the educational program of lectures will continue, preparing you for arrival at jaw-dropping South Georgia. ",,,,,,Days 7 to 9,South Georgia,"Often referred to as the 'Galapagos of the Southern Ocean', South Georgia is a wildlife paradise. It boasts several landing sites home to up to 500,000 king penguins and three million breeding pairs of macaroni penguins. The region is also renowned for its enormous elephant seal colonies, where the huge creatures can often be seen lounging in the surf and maintaining their territories. Feisty fur seals also litter the beaches, with opportunistic scavenger birds such as snowy sheathbills and skuas adding to the melee. History is also part and parcel of a trip to South Georgia, though it can sometimes be quite haunting as you learn of the damage wrought by decades of sealing and whaling.  One of the island's most notable sites is Grytviken, the iconic whaling station where legendary British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton is laid to rest.Your time exploring South Georgia will be heavily dictated by the weather conditions influencing this notoriously windy island. Wildlife can also cause plans to change, as sometimes the beaches are so heavily laden with seals and penguins that it's impossible to land!

You may be able to participate in citizen science activities, including bird species counts and cloud surveys for a NASA observation project. ",,,,,,Days 12 to 15,Navigating the Antarctic Peninsula,"With its heavily crevassed and seemingly endless glaciers, towering icebergs and snow-laden islands, the Antarctic Peninsula offers the iconic polar experience. This accessible region lays claim to active scientific research bases and awe-inspiring landscapes. As you head on shore, the penguins you encounter will be more petite than the kings you've met in South Georgia, but arguably more comical with their energetic waddling to and from their rookeries. Zodiac cruises will have you gliding amongst the sculptural icebergs, on the lookout for whales and seals. ",,,,,,Days 16 & 17,At sea,These last days at sea can be spent immersing yourself in the facilities of your chic ship.

As you peel away from South America, the next time you spot land you will be in the wilds of Antarctica! ",,,,,,,,,,,,Days 3 & 4,Crossing the Drake Passage,"Sailing across this renowned 500-mile (800km) waterway is a bucket-list experience for many travellers. From the deck of the ship, take in the mesmerising seascapes as they extend towards the distant horizon. Watch out for a variety of seabirds, including albatrosses, petrels and skuas as they gracefully soar over the powerful waves. As you near the Antarctic Peninsula, stay alert for your first sight of towering icebergs, carved into mind-boggling shapes by the power of the polar winds. By Day 4 you'll cross the Antarctic Convergence where the warmer subantarctic waters meet the colder Antarctic currents. During your days at sea, enjoy insightful presentations by the expedition team on topics such as photography, wildlife, glaciology and history. When not attending lectures, take advantage of time on deck to spot wildlife or relax with fellow travellers over a drink at the bar. ",,,,,,,Days 5 to 9,Exploring the Weddell Sea,"As the vessel reaches the Antarctic Peninsula, the Captain and Expedition Leader will constantly assess the weather and ice conditions, looking for the best possible opportunities for your expedition. The intention is to head to the north-eastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, into the little visited Weddell Sea. Each day on the Antarctic Peninsula will showcase the adaptability and expertise of your highly trained crew, both on the ship and in the air. During the course of your time in Antarctica the team will be aiming to offer three helicopter flights for all guests. Two of these will be flightseeing adventures of around 10-15 minutes in the air giving you incredible views of Antarctica's glacial beauty. The third excursion is intended to be a heli-landing, where the helicopter lands you in an otherwise inaccessible location.  However, please note that helicopter flights in Antarctica are highly dependent on the weather. This itinerary is designed to make sure every day is spent in breathtaking destinations that allow you to take to the skies when conditions allow or to maximise the wildlife and scenery you experience down on the ground on foot and by zodiac cruising if conditions are less than favourable for flight. If weather and ice conditions allow, you'll begin by sailing into the Antarctic Sound. Locations that you might explore here could include two towering geological landmarks: Madder Cliffs on Joinville Island and Brown Bluff at the northernmost tip of the Antarctic continent. There are large Adelie penguin colonies in the area, which you might explore via sturdy zodiac rib boat and gentoo penguins and seals are also often spotted along the coastline.You may have the chance to admire the distinctive 678-meter (2,225-foot) volcanic cliffs of Brown Bluff. If the weather cooperates, you might switch marine activities for your first flightseeing adventure of the trip, taking in the vastness of Antarctica from a snow petrel's perspective.As you continue through the Antarctic Sound and into Erebus and Terror Gulf, your Captain will strategically position the ship to make the most of both helicopter and zodiac excursions. The James Ross Island archipelago offers numerous opportunities to explore historically significant sites first trodden by humans during the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901-04. Upon landing, the team will check conditions to offer a trek to a summit for panoramic views of an Adelie penguin colony and the northern Weddell Sea. Home to fossil discoveries and ventifacts (ancient rocks smoothed by wind and sand) this area is renowned for its geological importance. The team will aim to show you ventifacts up close, offering a deeper understanding of how wind erosion, driven by sand or ice particles, shapes the landscape over time.  Before heading back across the Drake Passage, there may be some time to explore the rugged South Shetland Islands.  The team will see if conditions allow for a scenic helicopter flight over Livingston Island, home of the South Shetlands' most sublime peaks. From the air, you might see the impressive Tangra Mountains, stretching 20 miles (32km) in length and 5 miles (8.5km) in width, along with the sky-scraping Mount Friesland, Bowles Ridge and Pliska Ridge.",,,,,,Days 10 & 11,At sea,"As you travel back across the Drake Passage, spend some time unwinding after all those adventures by land and air.

It's a great time to familiarise yourself with the ship, scoping out the plentiful amenities along with the spacious deck areas. Head out on deck to look for some of the Southern Ocean's most iconic seabirds, including albatross with vast wingspans and giant petrels cruising alongside the ship. ",,,,,,,Days 5 to 7,Exploring South Georgia,"Jagged mountains draped in snow, jaw-droppingly large glaciers and crowds of wildlife come together to create one of the world's most extraordinary islands: South Georgia. On beaches densely packed with wildlife, immerse yourself in the trilling sounds of thousands of king penguins, the various trumpets of belligerent elephant seals and the huffing of feisty fur seals. Once a remote whaling hub and now a heavily protected wildlife haven, South Georgia's history is both haunting and inspiring, especially as the location of the epic finale of Sir Ernest Shackleton's legendary Antarctic rescue. In 1916, the heroic polar explorer reached these shores on a small boat, seeking rescue for his crew shipwrecked 800 miles (1,300 km) away on Elephant Island. In Grytviken, a museum honours Shackleton's incredible journey and a grave in the small whalers' cemetery marks his final resting place. The island's iconic king penguins gather in thousands-strong rookeries and are recognisable by their vibrant orange markings or the fluffy brown kiwi-like chicks. But other birdlife abounds, whether it be macaroni penguins, grey headed albatross or the small cape petrel. During your time in South Georgia you may explore on foot or by shoreline safari using your sturdy zodiac rib boats. Exploring from the water's edge is perfect for when the beaches are too heavily crowded with seals and penguins to keep the mandatory 16 foot (5 metre) distance from the abundant wildlife. ",,,,,,Days 8 & 9,Sea days,"Days at sea are the ideal chance to unwind. Head to the well-equipped gym, treat yourself in tranquil spa or spend time whale watching out on the spacious deck &ndash; there's plenty to keep you occupied on your luxury ship. These moments are the perfect antidote to those busy days spent exploring on shore once you reach the landing areas scheduled in by the Captain and Expedition Leader. However, the educational programme will continue, with excellent talks from your expert guides preparing you for the wildlife, history and geology of Antarctica. ",,,,,,Day 10,Elephant Island,"The plan on this day is to pause at Elephant Island, a place said to have taken its name from the elephant seals glimpsed on its rocky terrain by early explorers. This location was not extensively navigated until Sir Ernest Shackleton's aforementioned expedition in 1916. Shackleton's crew found shelter on the volcanic shores after a daring escape from their ship Endurance, which was crushed by ice in Antarctica's Weddell Sea region. Your expedition guides will retell the epic story during your visit. While it's near impossible to land on the island due to the notoriously challenging conditions, you may get to ship cruise past Point Wild, where the expedition's 28 desperate crew members set up camp for 4.5 months. Have your binoculars at the ready to see if you can spot the small monument to their endeavour.",,,,,,Days 11 to 13,Antarctica and the South Shetland Islands,"Antarctica's snow-shrouded landscapes and enormous ice formations make for an otherworldly experience. Untouched by people until 1820, the planet's least-explored continent offers the thrill of immersing yourself in the unknown. Everywhere you look, glaciers ripple down to the shoreline like icing pouring off a cake.  Mountain peaks stud the unique landscape, and small &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; looking marks from a distance often resolve into large rookeries of waddling penguins. Here you will be on the lookout for gentoo, chinstrap and perhaps even Adelie penguins. As you zodiac cruise around vast sculptural icebergs keep your eyes peeled for snoozing crabeater and Weddell seals and listen out for the blow of surfacing humpback whales. You might also visit the South Shetland Islands near the tip of the Peninsula. Here the scenery varies dramatically, with epic skylines and lunar landscapes formed by past volcanic activity. ",,,,,,,,Days 14 & 15,Sailing the Drake Passage,"A renowned stretch of ocean, sailing the Drake Passage an epic and unforgettable experience. You're never alone on this legendary crossing as soaring seabirds will accompany your ship &ndash; head out to the stern decks to capture them cruising past on the thermals.

Keep your lens poised for the blow of a humpback whale or the sight of seals lounging on ice floes as you cruise through pristine waters. The zodiacs will also shuttle you to shore, where you can capture the comical shuffle of penguins as they waddle along their well-worn &ldquo;highways&rdquo;.On land, you could wander along ice-strewn beaches while framing shots of glistening glaciers or hike to panoramic viewpoints that offer amazing compositions of the vast polar landscape below.
