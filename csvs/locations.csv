Bariloche,"San Carlos de Bariloche, which comes from the indigenous word 'Vuriloche' meaning ""people from behind the mountain"", lies on the edge of Lago Nahuel Huapi, a vast, blue lake which is popular with sea-kayakers. Bariloche is the gateway to the Argentinian lake district. Things to do in Bariloche For those looking for some adventure in the winter months, we'd recommend Bariloche's ski resort of Cerro Catedral, 7 miles from town. For some white water rafting, try the Rio Manso which has two sections; Manso Inferior and Manso de la Frontera. Manso Inferior is grade 2-3 and needs about 8 hours to raft. Manso de la Frontera is grade 3-4 and could take a few days to raft. Bariloche's luxury spas and hotels in the hills surrounding the town make the perfect base for day hikes into the Nahuel Huapi National Park (15 miles away in the north-eastern corner of the lake) and for longer mountain biking expeditions. Bariloche's glut of chocolate shops and its sandy beaches attract hoards of Argentinians in the summer months looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. The 'Circuito Chico' offers a leisurely trek and bus ride to spectacular viewpoints just outside Bariloche and, although quite touristy, the circuit is worth doing, in particular taking the ski lift up to the Cerro Campanario viewpoint for spectacular vistas of lakes Trebol and Moreno.

Castro,"Castro is the largest town on Chiloé island and also the oldest: the conquistador and royal governor of Chile Martín Ruiz de Gamboa founded a settlement on the quiet estuary here in 1567 to serve as a base to conquer the island’s Huilliche people. The town is famous for its shingle-roofed palafitos (waterfront stilt houses), which give it a much more attractive air than when a young Charles Darwin passed through in 183 and judged it a forlorn and depressing town. Today, it’s the island’s thriving capital and an important centre for Chile’s salmon industry.Castro’s most famous attraction today is the Iglesia San Francisco de Castro – one of the 16 wooden Chilote churches that make up the island’s UNESCO World Heritage listing. While many of Chiloé's churches can be rather plain in their beauty thanks to their Jesuit roots, the Franciscan church has an exuberant riot of colour covering its neo-Gothic twin-towered exterior. It was built in 1912 to replace its predecessor which had burned to the ground, and hides its iron frame in brightly painted alerce wood, with buttery yellows offset by mauve and violet details. The interior is plainer, with richly polished wood everywhere. Just south of Castro is a second prominent church, Iglesia Nuestra Señora de Gracia de Nercon , with a tall tower easily spotted from the road. Castro has two diverting museums: the Musei Regional de Castro on the main square, which has fine displays dedicated to the original Huillipihe inhabitants, and the Museo de Arte Moderno de Chiloé , which brings the island’s story up to date by showing off Chiloés burgeoning arts scene.

Cerro Castillo,"Cerro Castillo is a small farming settlement in southern Chilean Patagonia, not far from the larger town of Puerto Natales. Cerro Castillo is one of the landmarks on many horse riding trips in southern Patagonia as it evokes the 'estancia' lifestyle of this region. The fact that Cerro Castillo lies on the open pampas makes it a great base from which to go horse riding and gives you incredible views of Torres del Paine National Park in the distance. With regard to amenities, there isn't much save for a cafe (which does a very nice lamb soup) and shop with lots of books, clothes and goodies for tourists. The bus from Puerto Natales into Torres del Paine stops here en route. As does the bus from El Calafate, so on some trekking trips into Torres del Paine you can start from Calafate and join your group here at lunchtime, and head directly into the park that afternoon. For example this guided W Trek.

Dalcahue,"The small coastal town of Dalcahue is one of the best places on Chiloé for handicrafts shopping: its Sunday market attracts artisans from across the island to sell their wares. Woollen goods including jumpers, hats and chunky socks, all hand-dyed with natural pigments make the best souvenirs here. If you can’t make it on a Sunday, a smaller version of the market runs throughout the week. Chile’s 1960 earthquake saw the destruction of most of Dalcahue’s palafitos (waterfront stilt houses), but the town’s most important traditional wooden church survived the tremor. The Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores (Church of Our Lady of Sorrows) with its nine-arched facade, octagonal bell tower and interior barrel roof in simple whitewash was built in 1849, and is one of the 16 churches that collectively won Chiloé its UNESCO World Heritage-listed status in 2015. From Dalcahue, it’s possible to take a short ferry trip across the channel to Quinchao Island , where you can visit the equally imposing Iglesia Santa María de Loreto , Chiloés oldest church, built by the Jesuits in 1740.","<p>The small coastal town of<b> Dalcahue</b> is one of the best places on <a href=""https://www.swoop-patagonia.com/chile/lake-district/chiloe"" target=""_blank"">Chiloé</a> for handicrafts shopping: its <b>Sunday market</b> attracts artisans from across the island to sell their wares.

Now you can watch the pumas in their natural habitat while on the same Estancia there is being practiced livestock farming, whereupon the sheep are being guarded by livestock guardian dogs, so that they don’t fall prey to the pumas.<br></p>",chile/torres-del-paine/horse-riding/estancia-amarga,Estancia,"Ruta Y camino sarmiento 150, Torres de Paine, Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena, Chile",https://imgix.swoop-patagonia.com/FARS_5_CLAUDIO-VIDAL_RTD_Puma-in-Torres-del-Paine.jpg,-50.975359,-72.779158,Patagonia,Torres del Paine,,https://imgix.swoop-patagonia.com/FARS_4_SEBASTIAN-SAITER-RTD-Shooting-puma-Torres-del-Paine.jpg,https://imgix.swoop-patagonia.com/SWO_4_DannyMiddleton_ALL_puma-tracking-Torres-del-Paine-.jpg,,

Laguna Amarga,"Laguna Amarga is one of the best places on earth to observe pumas in the wild. Nowhere else the population density is as high as on this Ranch. Previously it was common practice for the land owners to hunt pumas, in order to avoid that those kill their sheep. Now however, there has grown a new generation on the Estancias, advocating for a tolerant cooperation. Now you can watch the pumas in their natural habitat while on the same Estancia there is being practiced livestock farming, whereupon the sheep are being guarded by livestock guardian dogs, so that they don’t fall prey to the pumas.

Laguna de Los Tres,"Laguna de los Tres is probably the most famous and most popular viewpoint for Cerro Fitz Roy.

The path up is well trodden and relatively easy going, with some steeper sections towards the top. Whilst there's only one approach to the laguna and the viewpoint, you can incorporate it into your itinerary in a few different ways: - Day hike from El Chalten. This is a route where you have to retrace your steps, but it's a varied and interesting route and the round-trip might take around 8 to 9 hours. - Start from Hosteria Pilar or Piedra del Fraile campsite to the North, and return back to El Chalten at the end of the day. This is again a full day of around 8 to 9 hours, but has the benefit of taking in Glaciar Piedras Blancas in the first part of the day, and you don't need to retrace your steps. - Use Camping Poincenot as base. This is a good option if you want to break it into shorter days; from here it's about an hour up to the viewpoint.

Lake Tagua Tagua,"Lake Tagua Tagua is a glacial finger lake in the Chilean Lake District sitting in 3000 hectares of forest that was turned into a Private Protected Area in 2013 dedicated to ecotourism. Access is by boat from the jetty at Puerto Canelo on Tagua Tagua’s northernmost point, a short walk from a cascading waterfall that marks the point where the Puelo River flows out of the lake to begin its descent to the Reconlavi Fjord. It’s possible to kayak near the falls or paddle to one of the lake’s many stony beaches. The surrounding landscape is thick with temperate rainforest and braided with well-marked hiking trails and walkways that climb the park’s steep slopes. The forest is well planted with Chilean cypress trees as well as ancient alerces, some of which might be as old as 3000 years. Under their branches, the forest floor is thick with ferns and fuschias that thrive in the damp alpine climate. The park has three refugios, Notros, Alerces and Quetrus. The first is near the entrance to the park, while the other two reward hikers prepared for a 7km and 10km respectively with truly spectacular locations. Refugio Alerces looks out across the ghostly fingers of long-dead alerces trees poking out from the waters, while Refugio Quetrus is at is near a smaller lake of the same name, which opens out to give tremendous views of the surrounding granite peaks. At the southern end of Lake Tagua Tagua is the Mitico Puelo Lodge , a former fishing lodge offering hikers a taste of mountain luxury. Lake Tagua Tagua is around a four hour drive from either Puerto Montt or Puerto Varas, via Cochamó. Mitico Puelo Lodge is a 40-minute boat ride from the Puerto Canelo jetty.","<p><b>Lake Tagua Tagua</b> is a glacial finger lake in the <a href=""https://www.swoop-patagonia.com/chile/lake-district"" target=""_blank"">Chilean Lake District</a> sitting in 3000 hectares of forest that was turned into a Private Protected Area in 2013 dedicated to ecotourism.

Piedra del Fraile,"This is a really charming campsite in the Electrico valley to the north of Mount Fitz Roy. The ""piedra"" refers to a huge boulder once dumped in the valley by the glacier. The boulder provides a good degree of shelter in what is otherwise a very exposed valley on the edge of the South Patagonian Ice Cap.The campsite itself is small (maybe 10-15 pitches) and relatively basic (a few shelters for cooking and basic washrooms), but there's a great hut with a wood-burning stove (and a very content dog), and it serves surprisingly good pizzas and cold beers.Piedra del Fraile could either be a destination in itself or a nice stopping off point en route to the Marconi Pass and the Ice Cap , the Polllone valley or Piedra Negra.

Puerto Montt,"Puerto Montt is the capital of Chile’s Los Lagos region, and serves as one of the major entry points to the Chilean Lake District and Chiloé island, as well as cruises through the Llanquihue Archipelago to the epic landscapes of Chile's northern fjords. It’s set in a spectacular location on the Reloncaví Sound, fringed with richly forested mountains, but the city itself is very much a working port: most travellers quickly transit the city to make the short hop to the pretty adventure hub of Puerto Varas, a quick 30 minute drive away, or to Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park to climb Osorno volcano.The city’s no-frills atmosphere is underlined by the fact that it was levelled by an earthquake in 1960, almost completely destroying the alpine architecture beloved by the German colonists who founded the town in 1853. The Catedral de Puerto Montt , built in alerce wood with a copper dome three years after the town was established, is the city’s oldest building. The city is built on Mapuche territory, but human habitation here stretches back farther than almost anywhere in the whole of the Americas. At nearby Monte Verde , archaeological remains including hearths, butchered animal remains and even a human footprint were uncovered in 1975 dating back around 18,500 years – a discovery that pushed back the earliest arrival of people on the South American continent by 1000 years. Puerto Montt’s Tepual airport (code PMC) is just 16km west of the town and is served by both LAN and Sky Airlines. From here you can fly to Santiago in just two hours, or south to Punta Arenas to access Torres del Paine National Park. If you want to take the scenic route to Torres del Paine, Puerto Montt is also the departure port for the four day/three night Navimag ferry to Puerto Natales, sailing through Chile’s spectacular fjords. There are no direct ferries from here to Chiloé island. Instead, you must drive 62km south on the mainland to Pargua to catch the car ferry to Chacao. Allow around three hours to transit from Puerto Montt to Ancud on Chiloé, including the 30 minute ferry ride.

Seno Última Esperanza (Last Hope Sound),"Seno Última Esperanza gets its name from Captain Juan de Ladrillero, who in 1557 went searching for the western entrance to the Strait of Magellan. After several weeks of searching, and in desperate need of food and water, he eventually found this fjord and was able to stock up on provisions in what is now Puerto Natales. Out of his joy at finding what he thought was the Strait, he named the fjord 'Seno Última Esperanza' or 'Sound of Last Hope'. A fun way to explore this fjord is by catching the ferry from Glaciar Serrano, just on the border of Torres del Paine National Park, down the Serrano river. On its way back to Puerto Natales, the ferry stops at Estancia Perales for you to enjoy a delicious lamb asado, before you continue on for the 2-hour journey back to Puerto Natales harbour. A handful of operators offer kayaking trips in the Seno Ultima Esperanza. This is a peaceful location where you can paddle up to a waterfall and camp out on the fjord's green banks.","<p>Seno Última Esperanza gets its name from Captain Juan de Ladrillero, who in 1557 went searching for the western entrance to the Strait of Magellan.

Temuco,"The capital city of Chile’s Araucanía region, Temuco is an important gateway to both the Chilean Lake District and the adventure capital of Pucón, as well as being the main access point for Conguíllo National Park. For Chileans it’s known best as the city where their national poet Pablo Neruda grew up and had some of his earliest poetry published. Temuco was founded in 1881 in the heartlands of Mapuche territory. It’s complicated colonial history is on display in the city’s Plaza de Armas Aníbal Pinto , named for the president who ordered the town’s creation. In the plaza’s centre stands a massive statue called Homenaje a la Regíon de la Araucanía (Tribute to the Araucanía Region), which shows a female Mapuche shaman with a raised drum on a rocky plinth surrounded on four sides by the Mapuche leader Kallfulifan, the conquistador-poet Alonso de Ercilla, a soldier of the pacification and a modern colonist. The excellent Museo Regional de la Araucanía has a strong focus on Mapuche culture. On the northern edge of Temuco, the Monumento Natural Cerro Ñielol is a 90 hectare reserve of native forest, on the spot where Mapuche leaders ceded their territory to the colonists for the founding of the town. The city is a major transport hub. Temuco’s Araucanía Airport (code ZCO) is 21km south of the city. From here it’s around a 90 minute flight to Santiago. Connections to Puerto Montt are also routed through Santiago; there are no direct flights from Temuco. Pucón is 105km south of Temuco – about a 90 minute drive.

Valle Frances,"Where to find it Torres del Paine National Park, Chile What is it? Valle Frances (the French Valley) is a deep valley between mountains in Torres del Paine and is one of the main hiking attractions in the national park. It is dominated by a magnificent hanging glacier, Glaciar Frances, beech forests and the French River.It takes roughly two hours to trek into the valley before you get your first glimpse of the glacier and you can hear the rumble of small avalanches in the distance and watch ice calving from its face. How can I see it? You will hike the French Valley on Torres del Paine's two most famous multi-day hikes, the Full Circuit and the W Trek. It's also possible to do it as a day hike as part of a series of day trips in Torres del Paine, returning to a comfortable base each night.On the Full Circuit you typically approach the French Valley from the east, starting from the nearest refugio, Paine Grande. On the W Trek you'd most likely start from the west, trekking from nearby Refugio los Cuernos. The weather is famously temperamental here, and a thick mist can descend making it impossible to reach the end of the valley. However if you do make it up to the end of the valley, expect spectacular views of Cerro Cota (2000m) and Cerro Catedral (2200m), a mountain which is said to resemble a cathedral facade.
